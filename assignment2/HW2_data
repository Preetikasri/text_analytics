Its amazing how they are designing torque steer out of the drive-trains.I think they are starting to look at active differentials to allow more power through the wheels doing the turning and the stopping.  Things like the Prelude SH and the Acuras with SH might be one way to cope, and help the outside front tire pull the car through the turn.",lilengineerboy
1,"May  1, 2007  6:45PM","Having seen the spy photos of the Accord Coupe, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say I like the styling of the 2008 Accord more-so than the Altima, in coupe form anyway. What they do with the rear-end could make or break them.",thegraduate
2,"May  1, 2007  7:03PM","torque steer and FWD cars is an interesting problem- remember that my old 92 Maxima at 190hp was a handful at times even more so than my wife's 240hp 03 Altima. My personal driver, an Avalon, has no discernable torque steer I think largely eliminated thru transmission and DBW throttle programming (the new TL-S does it this way as well) by simply delaying gear and throttle engagements - but it can be annoying. Other approaches that I've heard working is lowering the engine in such a way that the halfshaft angles to the wheel centerlines are almost flat. But, in any case, none of this 'solves' weight distribution and understeer issues. Overall, however, for those folks that do have to spend some time on snowy roads, I still believe that FWD is the setup of choice.",captain2
3,"May  1, 2007  7:25PM","How funny, I had a '72 Vega as well and I know mine was a hatchback.  It had the 2300cc engine, 4 speed on the floor.  I promise you the next time I'm in Traverse City, I'll go to the Saturn dealer and sit in your Aura XR.  The least I can do for my earlier rude comment.  I did look at a Hyundai Azera, Wow really nice car.  The Ford Fusion didn't do it for me but still nice.  Acura TL and Infinity G35 also in the hunt, but another 5 of 6 thousand more for what I wanted.",bv050506
4,"May  1, 2007  7:33PM","My folks had a Vega too, but that was mostly before I existed so I didn't count that in my list of cars and durability.  I think most people know how that would've worked out :lemon: Its interesting though, that car was very innovative in that it used aluminum for the block in a mass production car.  If they had just finished testing before they started selling it and realized they needed to put steel sleeves in the cylinders, it would've been fine.  That seemed to be a common complaint with domestics in the past, now people are frustrated they are not innovative enough...",lilengineerboy
5,"May  1, 2007  8:05PM","my son didn't feel like diving in to learn a stick. I offered to teach him, he got a weird look on his face and declined my offer. I re-offered and he said automatics are fine for him. I told him that he could learn and it was a ""do-able"" thing and I would spend the time but he didn't want to.He has his license still and I'm glad he at least wants to drive.I think he'll dig my Lancer GTS a lot and will want to take it for a spin. I am grateful to my Dad for teaching me how to drive a stick. We had a zippy little 4-speed '66 VW Fastback that I could drive pert-near whenever I wanted though it remained my parents car. Good for you for teaching your son. I am one who does not want manual tranny's to die off, I'm just taking a little diversion from them on this rig. :P",iluvmysephia1
6,"May  1, 2007  9:01PM","Perhaps learning to drive a stick is critical to really understanding how a car reacts and behaves in certain circumstances, as well as a basic understanding of a car's operational dynamics? That ability, driving a stick, ought to be required for all young drivers, IMO.",captain2
7,"May  1, 2007  9:10PM","the Vega perhaps the beginning of the end of 'Detroit' in the car business - whether it be melting engines in Vegas or exploding gas tanks in Pintos while the Japanese by the mid 70s had really improved their offerings to a point that there really was no contest - a situation that a number of folks would contend still exists today.PS I have always regarded the Corvair, especially in its last few years, as the first (and perhaps only) innovative car that 'Detroit' ever built?",captain2

9,"May  1, 2007  9:28PM","Oh I think the domestics had a lot of innovation.  I know people who moved households using Chevy Citations.  The cargo capacity of those huge hatchbacks was incredible.  The Malibu Maxx was kind of the modern day version, but with far better driving dynamics and reliability. The Taurus was unlike anything in its price range in 1986.  It had very modern styling, great driving characteristics, and good versatility.Chrysler invented the minivan 3 times.  I think that counts as innovation, and they kind of pioneered the modular platform concept in mass production (K-cars and minivans on same platform).Saturn had very innovative body panels, and engines that were designed for the application proved to be robust if not smooth.Thats a few decades of innovation.  I think people see what they want to see.",lilengineerboy

12,"May  1, 2007 11:43PM","The question I pose for all to comment on is what do we really expect these days to be reasonable repair costs outside of maintainence items such as tires, brakes, batteries, fluid changes, belts/hoses, possibly CV joints etc. My vote will go for 150k with no reliability related failures over a time period of 6-7 years or so.I would agree on the time. I would like 6-7 years of minimal problems. We would not get that many miles in so short a time, though. We would only have 50-70K in that time. I can not expect 150K miles beacause that would be 15-20 years. I keep track of maintenance and repair costs. On older cars, most of the time I see $400-800 per year for this. This seems okay to me. When it gets up over $1000 in a year is when I start feeling like the car is having too many problems.",jeffyscott
13,"May  2, 2007 12:16AM","Hehe. I only say ""go out on a limb"" because I haven't seen the sedan version, but assuming it shares the front end with the coupe, I already like it a LOT, and like the fact that it doesn't look like the lights have grown all the way around the car like the Nissan's have.",thegraduate
14,"May  2, 2007 12:56AM",HUH??? Are you saying you trade a 2 year old Toyota/Honda in for a new one?  The dealer makes no profit?,scape2
15,"May  2, 2007 12:58AM","Where'd you get that? He said ""it was becoming an expensive hobby."" It is undoubtedly cheaper to buy new Hondas every two years than new domestic vehicles, based on resale values, but it doesn't mean it is without cost. I'm not sure why anyone would try putting words in the mouth of someone who drives a make of car that they didn't like, when they pride themselves on driving something ""different."" My father drives cars for about 60,000 miles, and by then, he's ready for something new and different. Last time his 2-year old Accord got rear ended though, he bought another JUST like it. Same color. Same powertrain. Same trim-level. I was amazed. He put 69,000 miles on it then couldn't take it anymore and got the car that had his eye since it came out. An Atomic Blue Civic EX Sedan. I wonder what he'll be driving in 2 more years?",thegraduate
16,"May  2, 2007  1:17AM","I don't put a lot of miles/year on my cars. I had only accumulated 140,000 miles in 12 years. I kept my 92 EX Accord for 12 years because I liked it so much, and it never gave me a problem I couldn't fix myself. The repairs made are 1. Tranny computer $450 2. Fuel pump $200 3. Brake master cylinder (my own fault for not changing the brake fluid) $50 4. Valve cover gasket and o-rings under rocker arms $50. Total cost to me $750. I also did my own maintenance, so the cost was minimal. If my 03 Accord gives me the same type of loyal service, the next car will also be an Accord.",elroy5
17,"May  2, 2007  2:30AM","I just hope that the accord coupe addresses the blind spots that are in the current model.  That was one thing that I kept me looking at other cars since the 4 door is seen everywhere it seems.  And any opinion if they do the 2 tier gauges like the civic?  Personally I wouldn't mind, but the huge sea of dash would be a mistake.  If they make the suspension a bit more firm, give it better brakes than current models, and give it a good stereo, that would be an amazing car for those of us who enjoy a spirited drive.",zzzoom6
18,"May  2, 2007  2:39AM","They won't have the 2-tier gauges. I've seen a spy shot on the net with a bit of interior. You can see it here, at the Temple of VTEC website.Looks like the conventional dash to me, although I had no problem getting accustomed to my father's 2007 Civic EX Sedan. Unconventional? Yeah. But it was pretty nice not being ""conventional"" for a change (I drive Accord 4-cyl, 4-doors, so conventional/practical is the norm for me).",thegraduate

You did great on your parts prices, I couldn't find a master cylinder for less than 3x that($150), and before I isolated the main relay from the fuel pump, the fuel pumps were more like $350 too.",lilengineerboy

I would argue they would be better off putting that type of two-tiered cluster in the Accord, since the typical buyer is usually older than a Civic buyer, and it offers real usability advantages for older drivers.  Go find one of those early 90s Buicks that still have the big rectangular speedometers and measure the character height, and then check that against the speedo in the double-deck Civic.  There are other advantages too but thats a start.",lilengineerboy
21,"May  2, 2007  1:41PM","HUH??? Are you saying you trade a 2 year old Toyota/Honda in for a new one? The dealer makes no profit?No - I said I keep each about 4 years, but do it every 2 years. Traded my wife's Camry in on an Odyssey. They gave us what we owed on the car as a trade-in value (was a 5 year loan initially and we put nothing down) and we paid what Edmunds said was the going price for the van.I did the same with an Accord. They gave me what my payoff was for the car (again - had a 5 year loan, no money down initially) and I paid (again) what Edmunds said was the going price of an Acura TL.Both times these cars were legitimately worth what the payoff was on them (or more) which made them both real easy to get out of and into the next vehicle. The dealer wanted my trades. Not many other makes can you get out of them for the payoff in the early years of ownership.This scenario NEVER happened when I traded in the Fords we owned. Especially the Taurus. The dealer didn't want my trade.",goodegg
22,"May  2, 2007  2:03PM",That's because the Taurus had huge incentives and huge rental fleet presence which killed resale values.Estimate resale on the Fusion is just under the Accord and just above the Camry.  Why?  Because they aren't putting huge amounts of cash on the hood and they're not dumping them into rental fleets and the quality is just as good as the competition (or better - so far).  If you make regular payments for 4 years on a 5 yr loan with nothing down and you don't have any equity - something's wrong.  You'd be better off leasing if you know you want a new car every 4 years and you aren't paying them off early.,akirby

I actually bought a main relay for it when the fuel pump went out (thinking it was the problem), so when I sold the car, there was an extra one in the trunk. The only part I bought from Honda was the tranny computer, and I could have probably got a good used one for much less. All the parts were probably bought about ten years ago. I think just about everything happened between 100k and 120k miles.",elroy5
24,"May  2, 2007  9:02PM",You'd be better off leasing if you know you want a new car every 4 years and you aren't paying them off early.Leases are much harder to get out of than owning. I've done both. Leases handcuff you more.Altho a lease on an 07 Accord should be pretty attractive right now with a MY change looming.,goodegg
25,"May  2, 2007 10:19PM","I was just having fun.  I'll actually agree with you.  the altima coupe didn't impress me all that much.  It's a nice enough car and I wouldn't mind having one.  But, there's just something about the rear that doesn't look quite right.  Kind of looks like they stole some design from the Z, but that doesn't look quite right on that car.As for the sedan, I'll be interested in seeing it.  The last few versions of the accord have given me that old man-mid level management feel.  It's almost shocking to see someone under 40 driving one.  will be real interesting to see what dirrection they go in.",jd10013

29,"May  2, 2007 11:39PM","I don't expect any major engine or trans problems for the life of the vehicle.  At least, since I started buying japanese cars.  My last 4 purchases have been 3 nissan's and a honda.  I still have (and are running fine) all but the first nissan i bought in 1992.  And I only got rid of that because it was starting to nickel and dime me to death.  Engine/trans/body were fine.  To me, that's the only downside to the longevity of japanese cars.  When up around 12+ years/200k+ miles, because so many parts are still original, a LOT of things start to wear out at the same time.  Instead of fixing things here and there, I have no problems at all for what seems like forever, then all of a sudden, everything starts to go.",jd10013
