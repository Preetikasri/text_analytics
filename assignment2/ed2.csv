The answer to that one question after a car is selected will determine if the customer is a buyer.

Great responses. To sell, you have to find out if there are objections....and then have an answer that solves it.
Another thing is to try to ask a question that has to be answered with more than a 'NO"". For example, rather than asking can I help you today, ask, is there a particular model you are looking for? NO, ends the conversation, a good question opens up the possibility of a conversation."

I would be as honest as possible, and say, ""I am considering this model, but I want to compare it to an X or even an X and Y"". And that is a very fair and reasonable thing to say."

The answer to that one question after a car is selected will determine if the customer is a buyer.  Examples of possible responses are:

1 Well, I need my wife here to decide
2 I don't have my checkbook
3 I have 4 more payments left on my lease
4 I really wanted leather seats..or..etc.
5 Well, I am really just looking
6 The car is for my daughter
7 Yes!

Answers 1-6 are objections to buying now.  It means the salesman must eliminate all objections except the price before he can proceed.  

1 Here’s the Keys- Drive It home and let her see it.

2 A credit card is fine or we have an internal draft you can sign until you bring in the check

3 I can take care of those remaining payments by buying the car from the leasing company

4 I have a car in stock exactly the way you want it equipped with leather seats “or” I can get that exact car by tomorrow morning 

5 No problem.  We have the car you want and I know we can price it right where you want to be.  How much did You want to pay?  $600 a month?  I know I can get it st that price or possibly less.

6 Let’s Drive the car to your daughter and have her test drive the car to see if it fits her needs.

7 OK, let’s see what I can do with management to get your price.

There are other approaches - but once you have a selection of a desirable vehicle, negotiations begin.  Without a solid selection, you have nothing.


Mike, thanks for the Master Class. This is truly the art of the deal. Come to think of it I don't remember any car salesman trying these tactics on me."

It seems some salespeople think they can tell if someone is a serious buyer.

A few years ago I went to look at the previous model Ford Fusion. A former friend of mine was selling Fords so that made it easy.

When I showed up at the dealership he had one of the assistants they had there take me out in his demo Fusion. It was a used car he was driving at the time. It said ""9 miles to empty"" on the gas gauge and the brakes were shot. You had to pump them to stop.

He just didn't seem interested so I left.

A year or so later he made a comment that I wasn't a serious buyer then. He couldn't have been more wrong. I bought a Buick Regal 2 days later.

It makes you wonder how often this happens and how many sales are lost because a salesperson is a know-it-all."

Determining whether a customer is a buyer or not is not the single most important element in sales.  The most important element is developing a relationship with the customer.

Just because a customer comes into the showroom and states they are just looking or they are comparing brands is not important.  The job is to turn that looker into a future customer who will come back asking for you.

I can’t tell you how many “lookers” have bought cars from me that first visit - it’s because I was interested in what they wanted or needed or just providing him/her with honest and truthful information.  It’s developing a relationship with the customer."

Why?  Because that is how sales are made, karhill.  Most customers are not as aggressive as you claim they are or should be.  Whenever I would greet an aggressive or cocky customer, I just relaxed and let him control things until I had developed a relationship.  Rather than fight him, i just relaxed.  If I felt I was being “run over” by a customer, I let him “run me over” until he satisfied himself that he was in total control.  That is the way to deal with aggressive buyers.  Provide answers to his questions and if the interactions became overwhelming, I just thanked him for coming in.

Obnoxious customers are different.  They not only want control, but are nasty and antagonistic.  Those are the ones I just let the sales manager handle when I sold cars.  When I was a sales manager, if they continued their “run me over” attitude, I just gave them the name of a competing dealership and showed them the door.

But those cases were few and far between - thank goodness."

The customer always has control, they are the one who decides if there will be a sale or not. The salesman can control the conversation all he wants, I control the sale."
10,12:57PM,dino001,"snakeweasel said:

Everyone is a payment buyer, the question is how many payments are they going to make?
Not really. The real questions are how much do you want for the car, what's the cost of the money (if applicable) in a particular form of financing, and how much will you give me for my car, if I trade in. The payment will come out of that automatically and in places I have bought my cars the don't make ""math errors"" at F&I. If they did, that would be end of discussion. I could afford twice or now even thrice the payment that is appropriate for a vehicle and term I'm seeking (not that it would be a good idea), so discussion of $XX per month is completely irrelevant to me.

""Afford"" is never a question to me for the vehicles I'm buying - I figure that way before I come to a place, it's only how much do you will sell it for, so all that discussion on Youtube, while entertaining, makes no difference to me - other than any attempt like that would make me walk away after couple of minutes. I suspect though, really good salesman/closer would know that, so they'd keep things on target. Especially, considering that I'm not overly ""greedy"" on my expectations. I won't let them push me into excessive markups, but I don't need a ""deal of a Century"" to close, either. And ""per month"" screamer offers really annoy me, especially if they don't disclose enough pertinent details (which always is the case). I remember once a young Mazda guy (long time ago) insisted on them to pencil me an ""offer"", after I just wanted to test drive it. I had another 30 minutes to kill, so I said OK. Then he brings that magic XX/month for 60 months on some form. So I ask him what's the interest rate, ""I don't know"", show me components for this number, he stared at me like I just asked him to write a Shrodinger's equation. I knew that was it, so I thanked him for his time. He was still asking ""is the number OK?"", I was like ""I don't know enough to say"". I wasn't buying anyway, but the approach to business told me this was NOT the place I wanted to go, if actually shopped for Mazda."

I treated every person that walked into our showroom as a potential buyer in that I gave everyone the same amount of attention and respect. My second sale was to a couple that were ""just looking"" to replace their totaled E46 M3; they test drove an M240i and at the end of the test drive decided to buy it on the spot. What was really kind of funny was that the salesman who usually exceeded his targets every month had a couple coming in to look at the same car. They rolled up just after my NCM accepted my customers' offer. The other customers didn't have a deposit on the car so they only got a quick glance at it before I drove it to the detail bay..."

A**holes are everywhere, customers, salespeople, managers. It's quite funny. I know the type - the world is out to get them, constantly unhappy, constantly smelling a conspiracy. However, I do keep my guard in places I described before (some of those ""popular"" brand dealership). Those places bring worst in people on both sides. They breed not only bad sales and managing staff, they also breed bad customers. Many people would become combative and nasty after experiencing enough of that stuff over there that they won't believe that other places can do business a different way. If you are a Honda buyer in Tampa Bay, for example, you simply have no choice but endure this boiler room environment, if you want to buy one. The curse with them is that the product is good enough for people to take that abuse - especially that stored of their direct competitor, Toyota, is not much better, or can be worse. Buy three-four Hondas or Toyotas that way and you believe everybody else is like that.

BTW, there were some other outfits in the area that were even worse, literally criminal. The most infamous was thank God defunct Bill Heards Chevrolet. You read stuff you can't even believe was possible. I only think those people who used to work in place like that - how they slept at night and looked at the mirror in the morning."
15,1:35PM,graphicguy,"@abacomike ...only when you have a solid selection, the negotiations can start....

Mike....could not agree with you more. If the selection isn’t done, or you’re just kicking tires on more than one car, nothing’s going to happen.

I can’t tell you how many sales people have tried to close me in the lot while I’m browsing several cars.

Some examples...

“You buying today?”-I dunno.....I’m not sure you have anything I want.

“This is a great car for families. Yours would love it”.-The car would be only for me.

“The car you’re looking at is one of our most popular colors”-I’m not very fond of it.

“Let’s fill out a credit app to save you time”.-Ummmmm.....let’s not. I don’t even know if you have what I want.

The list goes on and on. All resulting in a “no sale”."

Old school thinking. The old “I’ll control the sales process”. If control is what you want, roll into the showroom with a wad of Benjamins and yell to anyone who will listen “who wants to sell me a car?”.

You want to waste time? Keep trying to work towards controlling instead of getting the car you want at the deal you want.

I’ve said this time and again, if you walk into the dealership thinking you’re going to grind, you’ll lose.

1. You don’t know the price you’re going to pay before you walk in the door because you’re focused on grinding that last $50 instead of what you’ll be spending overall

2. What you save on the front end, you’ll give away on the back end.

For the last 15-20 years, I figure out what the car is worth and what it can be sold for. I add in my “pre-figured” tax, title and license fees. And, then present that number to the sales person/manager. They can either accept it or reject it. If they reject it, I move on. If they accept it, I just bought a car.

They get ONE NUMBER. I don’t care what their doc fee is. I don’t care what addies they may try to charge for. There’s no bumping for extraneous fees in F&I. The number is the number.

Negotions are easy. No stress. I’m happy with the deal (since I penciled it) and the dealer is happy with the deal (since they accepted it). It’s quick, too."

Not really. And a lot of other stuff deleted to save bandwidth so there more room on the internet for cat memes.
Well unless the dealership is giving away cars everyone is a payment buyer, even if it is just one payment. 

Personally I really don't care how they come up with the numbers, in the end all that matters is how the cash flows. If I want that new Sludgemobile LX and my research shows that $25K is a real good price and I will put down $5K and I can get a 48 month loan at 4% then I know my monthly payment would be $502.95 a month (presuming 8.5% sales tax and $150 for tags). Now if they come up with that monthly payment or less why should I care how they got it? It still meets or beats what I figured out was a good deal. If they give me the car for free charge me $6K in doc fees and charge me 363.5% interest for 48 months I'm still at the $502.95 a month."
21,2:29PM,dino001,"Today it really is much easier, as you can see the inventory on line, so you can figure out real price before walking in. It wasn't as easy years ago, you didn't know what they had and the range of prices is too large to come with ""one number"", unless you come with exact configuration in mind and you either hit it or not. Otherwise, you'd need some formula to figure it out on the spot.

I was fortunate not to run into too many ""buy today"" people. Probably because I stayed away from those places, but most likely they almost never had the configuration I wanted. My taste has always been ""off the mainstream"".

For example, last time I bought my 430, I came to a Volvo place, as I considered red V60 wagon, R-trim. But they don't have a single V60-R in stock, other dealers in the area may have couple in black or white. They have S60 sedan in the same engine trim. I ask them to show it to me and I want to test drive it. I'd mention multiple times during the test drive that I'm also considering 430, I would tell them what I like, what I don't and I still have things to look at. We talk enough details so they know I didn't come to joyride, I'm really looking into it, most likely an order. We may even mention pricing (their usual opening salvo is MSRP, or something like 1000 bucks off). I may discuss it further, or not, depends on my mood. There is no room for ""close today"" in this whole conversation no matter how much they may try and they know they'd likely lose the sale if they started the whole dance and push right now. We shake hands, I take the card and keep contact until decide. I'd do that in two-three dealerships per model, as there is always something new to learn about the car each time. Once I decide what, I take an offer from one dealer away, so I know I have somewhere to go and I go to the frontrunner. I strike the deal based on that offer with an extra concession, but nothing outrageous, they agree fairly quickly. It most likely leaves something on the table, but I don't care. I let the rest know it's over, I owe them that much."

You figure it out and see if its 2018. Its a thousand-year wait! Good shot! 
So... just as an example, someone born in 1900 would add their age, 118, to their birth year and get 2018. Well...yes... because addition works. It also worked EVERY year. Same with someone born in 1954, who would turn 64 this year 1954+64=2018... but also in 1969 when they turned 15, 1954+15 =1969
