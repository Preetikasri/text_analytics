0,September 7,dino001,"If they keep it around in next four-five years, I think I will make myself to put on a hazmat suit and visit our friendly Kia dealer (oh, boy are they horrible here, or what) to check it out. It's got a lot of good stuff, but seems like they are still behind on a few things, such as relationship between power and gas mileage (e.g. BMW 340/440 has similar performance, but much better gas mileage as a daily driver), but with appropriate price difference, those objections and shortcomings are not insurmountable. Biggest thing will be the ""first contact"" with a sales person. Hope it won't start from ""are you buying it today?"", ""what can I do to make you take it home?"", or ""let me wash your BMW - oh, I can't find the keys"", ""How about I show you the deal - square one, two, three, four""."

Yes, the completely noncomparable M2 would beat the Stinger on track, as would a corvette or sportbike, BTW."

The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side.
I still think my next car will be either an M2 or an M2C.
Why not a Genesis G70 with a manual?"

Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers? If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers."
6,September 9,roadburner,"Thanks, but I am more than aware of the distinction. The dealer group that owns the future Genesis store(and the current Hyundai store) has less than a stellar reputation. I suspect that their Genesis sales ""experience"" would still require me to take a long hot shower afterwards. Not worth my time."

Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store. It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer. It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those. Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership. The difference is subtle, but perceptable. It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment). To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone."

Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....

Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination.

PS Now that I've driven both the TLX and my wife's CR-V a lot, I've decided I like non-turbo engines slightly better. The 1.5T on the CR-V does have maybe a third of a second delay in acceleration when you floor it—but in certain situations that can seem like a substantial delay. And so turbo lag has been reduced with these new engines, but not completely eliminated.

PPS My guess is that the next generation TLX, due in maybe a year or so, will go turbo and take out the 4-wheel steering. I'd rather have a naturally aspirated engine and the 4WS. Right now I am hoping to finance the residual on the TLX when the lease is up, if we can afford it at that time. It's a really nice car that I'd like to keep long-term."

Floor it in a Audi with DSG on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem.

My guess is that the delay is more due to programming and transmission ineptitude than on the turbo lag. Does the CVT make an appearance in the CRV?"

i think you'd enjoy four-wheel DRIVING even more than steering. Did you consider or test drive the TLX with SH-AWD? I know you probably wouldn't like the fuel economy penalty, but a test drive wouldn't hurt to give consideration for the fun factor. Although, I'd imagine the 4-banger might be overtapped with AWD.
A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year.

But the 4-wheel steering on the TLX is enjoyable. I worry now that I won't want a car without this feature in the future. But given that Acuras with good maintenance and some luck tend to last a long time, this is a car that may—knock on wood—be with me for a while."

I've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me).

Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."

Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."

The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle.

The A4 is also a very nice design, and the Audi is maybe the best-looking entry-level luxury car right now imho. The TLX is close, but I do think that the Acura calipers on the front grill are maybe a bit too large, like it's trying a little too hard? I'm getting used to it, but I think the styling details on the Audi are very nice.

I guess the real bargain for leasing when it comes to entry-level luxury cars is the ILX, which is basically the fanciest and most powerful 2015 Civic ever. Still, with a lease price of c. $200 a month it's a good deal for the money. It's close to the same price as leasing a Civic.

Your 2013 Accord EX might be worth c. $11-12k at trade-in, which obviously means that you have a big downpayment. Would you lean toward leasing or buying?

For entry-level luxury cars the lease deals seem better than the purchase deals."

What happens when you like driving your new car too much? In just five weeks of ownership I've put c.3300 miles on it on my newly leased TLX Tech. I love the handling, the stereo, the engine, the transmission, the seats, etc. And so I've been going on lots of fun trips to see old friends, driven to sites in town I haven't seen, and I've also been driving to cities I've never before visited. Since I'm a prof. (which perhaps explains a few things) once the school year starts in a couple of weeks I won't be driving so much since I'll be working all the time. So that should slow down the miles, and then I'll also probably start driving my wife's new CR-V sometimes when going back and forth to Lexington.

But yikes...."
63,August 4,benjaminh,"With destination the starting price for an Acura TLX is $33,995. That's a lot of money, but for that price the TLX comes with a moonroof, power heated seats, AcuraWatch, etc., etc. An Audi A4, BMW 320i, or Lexus ES350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the TLX seem pretty good. But some people put the A4, 320i, and ES350 in a higher category than the TLX.

For the entry-level model TLX probably some are cross-shopping the Accord EXL 1.5, which has an msrp with destination of about $31k. So one way to look at it would be what does the TLX base have that makes it worth $3000 more than an Accord EXL.

Here's my very subjective valuation of what the added features and qualities of the TLX are worth to me personally over an Accord EXL....

The exclusive 4-wheel steering of the TLX would be worth to me as an option at least $1200. The 4WS really helps make the steering better, from parallel parking, to medium speed cornering, to higher speed lane changes. Great system imho.

The 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter is worth at least $800 to me compared to the Accord's CVT.

The better suspension of the TLX compared to the Accord is worth at least $500 to me.

The quieter ride of the TLX is also worth about $500 to me.

The TLX's better and bigger brakes with their ""Premium Bosch 6-piston brake modulator"" another 500. Plus the ten spoke wheels look better to me on the TLX than the strange designs found on the Accord.

The longer Acura warranty—4 year bumper to bumper, and 6 year/70,000 mile engine and transmission is also worth maybe 500 to me. And the fact that they threw in 2 years of maintenance in a much nicer waiting area reinforces that.

The nicer interior parts all throughout the inside the TLX, and the more interesting and better-looking to me sheetmetal outside is worth at least another 1000, and maybe twice that.

Very subjectively to me then the TLX does seem to be ""worth"" c. 5000+ more than a comparable Accord, making the added cost of 3k seem like a good deal. And with the lease incentives Acura offers it doesn't seem like you even pay that....?"

I teach art history—and I really enjoy it!

I think the standard audio in the TLX is similar to the top-of-the-line system in the Accord EXL/Touring. So it's a very good system that's quite a bit better than what you and I hear/heard in our EXs. The ELS takes it to the next level, but the starting system is already equal to the best that Honda offers—and maybe it's even a little bit better? In terms of the leatherette, I would have been happy with that too. In fact, imho it's less worry because leatherette will last longer than probably almost anything else on the car, while leather after 8 years or so might be reaching the danger zone even if cared for.

The seating position in the TLX is just slightly lower than in my 2016 Accord.

But like you I did find the seating position of the 2018 Accord maybe a little too low.

I do enjoy the Tech features, but if they had had a TLX base on the lot I might have gotten that one if it saved me money over the Tech. It happened that it was the very last TLX 2.4 they had."

I have always enjoyed history and am sure I would enjoy your class. When I went to The Univ of TN, Knoxville, I took several French culture classes that were a mix of history and reading books written by French authors. One class was taught by a professor who had participated in the French resistance during WWII. The stories and insight that she shared, wow. I am delighted you enjoy what you do, too many don't.

To stay on topic: I see more and more TLXs on the road. For first generation it is hard to tell the 2.4 from the V6, with the rim style/tire size being the real give away. Goodyear tires on the 2.4, Bridgestone tires on the V6."

That's better than I can do in the relatively light weight 7-speed Optima with the 1.6T engine. 28.4 would be an improvement. I'm gonna peg my lifetime average at 27 mpg.

I may not be, but it's nice. I just drove a rental TDI in Scotland for a week and I didn't feel much deprived vs. my 430 GC. The vehicle was a relative base (cloth seats, no Nav), but the overall level of equipment, fit and finish was quite good. Despite being FWD, it was nicely responsive, but I have to admit, the ""spritited"" handling was last thing on my mind there, as I was more focused on not hitting anything and constantly fighting my cross-wired senses (left is right, right is left). Nevertheless, it would have been quite good substitute if you didn't want to shell out as much money. Of course I didn't like that diesel's characteristics as much as my gas engine, but it wasn't a tractor, as say my late dad's 2005 A4 TDI."

There's a good aftermarket tune for those old TDI's. I experienced one in a loaner bug at my preferred shop. Of course, it might be spewing 80X the current standard emissions now.

So do entry level vintage luxury performance cars from the pre-smog era get excluded too?"

I don't really understand the question, but I'm the last one to place some kind strict categories with a checklist. People buy whatever they want and if they want to cross shop Escalade with Mazda Miata, it's weird, but it's their privilege. All I just meant to say my dad's A4 TDI is loud (it's still in the family, my nephey has it) at highway speeds and you definitely know it's a downsized tractor engine with slightly better vibration dampening and noise insulation good enough for you hear the radio at somewhat loud setting. Europeans liked those TDIs and Benz's old (slow, noisy and clunky) diesels long years before they bought into the ""diesel will save the planet and we just have it in our showroom"" lie, luxury or not."

i think you'd enjoy four-wheel DRIVING even more than steering. Did you consider or test drive the TLX with SH-AWD? I know you probably wouldn't like the fuel economy penalty, but a test drive wouldn't hurt to give consideration for the fun factor. Although, I'd imagine the 4-banger might be overtapped with AWD."

The version I got, the TLX 2.4, is close to being competitive with a base model 320i or A4.

In any case, my latest hand calculated mpg numbers for my TLX 2.4 are: 401 miles/11.8 gallons= 33.98 mpg. This time my gas station calculation was almost the same as the car's trip computer, which said I'd gotten 34.1 mpg over the same 401 miles. This was for about 80% highway.

I think I forgot to mention, why the hell is Acura putting GREEN X tires on a SH-AWD model (referring to KBB's review of a test model with those tires!?)?

That's an inappropriate tire for an A-spec model.

Changing out the tire to something like a Michelin Pilot Super Sport 4S would probably make the car twice as fun in the canyons, literally. I'm not exaggerating.

104,July 19,stickguy,"sorry to hear about your tranny issue. Seems though that is a really rare occurence on a BMW, with the ZF? I thought those were pretty bulletproof. But, can always get a lemon anything. The X2, will that replace the 330, or your other car (a 4 series?)

interesting readying on those tests. The Kia (RWD) is withing a 10th and 1 MPH of the Alfa in the quarter. Impressive. Less impressive is both cars having serious failure issues so early, and not surviving the test regimen. I wonder if they just went too far hopping up these sedans? Or some sheep in wolves clothing going on (fine for around town, and normal spirited driving, but just not really able to cope with wringing out all the performance)."

sorry to hear about your tranny issue. Seems though that is a really rare occurence on a BMW, with the ZF? I thought those were pretty bulletproof. But, can always get a lemon anything. The X2, will that replace the 330, or your other car (a 4 series?)

interesting readying on those tests. The Kia (RWD) is withing a 10th and 1 MPH of the Alfa in the quarter. Impressive. Less impressive is both cars having serious failure issues so early, and not surviving the test regimen. I wonder if they just went too far hopping up these sedans? Or some sheep in wolves clothing going on (fine for around town, and normal spirited driving, but just not really able to cope with wringing out all the performance).
Not sure what 1/4 mile times you are looking at, but they are far from close. Of course, the Alfa costs a helluva lot more."

and look at that for a minute, and think about the automotive world we live in. A freaking Kia, that most people could afford (I think a $41K sticker for that model), can pull off a quarter mile in the 12s at over 110 MPH!

So what happens at startup?

If you do have any interest in another BMW, lease a service loaner. Typically below the 1% threshold.
After the car sits for 12 hours And on start up the car lurches forward like it's not completely in natural. It doesn't make any noises like gears grinding, it has gotten worse in the 15 months I've had the car. Part of me says, screw it, I have less than 2 yrs left on the lease, the other half says, BMW knows there is a problem but they don't want to fix it.

My 330i was a service loaner, and yes, I got it less than 1% of MSRP."

I haven't read anyone issues like it mine with the ZF either on Bimmerfest or Bimmerpost. The ZF is a pretty build proof unit. The X2 will replace Ricks 328GT. He really liked the one I had as a loaner.

You know the 1/4 miles times and trap speed means nothing today. Most cars are going to be fast, fast enough to get you in trouble. My 330i will run the 1/4 in 13 sec's and about 100. 0-60 times in the high 5's (stock) drop a stage 1 onto (like I did) 0-60 in the mid 5 to low 5, and 1/4 times and speed goes up.

YUP..."
116,July 19,henryn,"I am forced to agree. A 12 second quarter mile is an impressive thing, but I doubt I will ever again do that. Or at least it would be a very rare occurrence. But I do like acceleration.

When I'm coming up the freeway on ramp, spot a hole in the traffic, punch it, and the car lunges forward, I mean really jumps -- yeah, I like that. Yes, I will pay extra for that.

But the difference in 1/4 mile times between the Kia and the Alfa -- not going to matter in my world. Both of them will jump just fine, more than enough for me.

A few years back, when I was seriously considering a used Genesis, I did several test drives. Both 6 cylinder models and V8's. The guy who wrote the review for Edmunds said you didn't need the V8, it would only be for bragging rights. A conclusion which I vehemently disagreed with.

I alternate two daily drivers, a Town and Country and an F150 with an Ecoboost. The Town and County is fast enough, it will get out of it's own way. But you have to punch it, wait for the downshift, wait for the engine to spool up, and THEN it will move pretty good. The Ecoboost, lightly touch the throttle and you are moving!"

I would say for sure a DCT is more efficient than a lowly CVT, but a DCT with a torque converter sounds less efficient, but it seems Acura found a good middle ground. There's a reason many people won't consider a car with a CVT, even if Honda does it better than just about anyone."

The only problem is that my trip computer said that I got 36.2 mpg for those 225 miles. Hmmm. I thought the trip computer's mpg numbers, which were seemingly slightly better than my Accord's, were maybe a little too good to be true. But the real number is still better than I expected, esp. given that the EPA highway rating on the TLX 2.4 is 33.

My son the engineer/computer coder said that my method of manually checking the mpg could have a margin of error as well. Who is to say that the shut of works exactly the same each time, or that you have the filler in the same amount? I guess he has a point?

There is also an adjustable thigh support (the front part of the cushion is separate and can move in and out) but again I notice little difference. Maybe a smaller person would appreciate these things more than I do. I am probably not the best judge of seats.

164,July 12,Mr_Shiftright,"No excuse for this, really. It has enough HP to be entertaining."
165,July 12,stickguy,sounds like something I might like. Sucker for hatches of this style. I can take my chances with a 14 second quarter. Super comfy seats are a big plus.

I do not find it attractive at all. The previous version was far better looking IMO, and inside, this one is not good at all. As a GM fan this car is a huge disappointment. Top that off with performance that is mid-pack at best and I suspect the model may not make it to the end of its 4-year production contract with PSA at the former GM plant in Russelsheim, at least for North American markets."
167,July 12,benjaminh,"After a week apart I got to drive my new TLX for more than an hour today, all in Sport mode, which is the way to go for the 2.4. One highway run of c.70 mph with AC had a car calculated 36.5 mpg. If that's not a fluke, and if the car's mpg calculator is accurate (the one on my Accord was) then the highway mpg is very close to what I got in the 2016 Accord. Still finding all sorts of little quality touches, such as the nice feeling carpet, and the hidden storage area in the trunk (no spare tire, just fix a flat). I'd rather have a tire, I think, but the honest truth is that I haven't changed a tire since about 1995. Since then I've always let AAA do it, or tow it, and I haven't had any regrets."

It has been several years since I last used a spare tire. And then, bang, last Saturday, blow out on my minivan. I hit something out on the freeway, never saw what it was. My wife (now ex) used AAA and other ""road service"" (USAA insurance) several times, and the average wait was 1 to 2 hours.

It took me about 15 minutes to get back on the road Saturday, and I thought that was rather long actually. Unfamiliarity with the mid-mounted spare, I actually had to dig out the owner's manual. IT guys really hate to RTFM.

Fix a flat doesn't cut it, in my opinion. This incident Saturday, there was a hole in the sidewall. I don't think any amount of ""goop"" would have done the trick.

I see now where some new cars offer a spare tire as an ""optional, extra cost item"". Is that your situation, @benjaminh ? If so, I would cough up the bucks.

YMMV"
169,July 12,stickguy,"Henry, I am with you. No spare tire is a hot button issue. Last blow out I had was at night, on a holiday, in the middle of nowhere. At least with the donut on I could get to a hotel, then next day find a tire store. The tire was shredded so yeah, no can of fix a flat was helping.

I believe the TLX (at least prior to 2018 redesign) had a spare as an option. The ILX definitely did. Heck, if you pulled out the tray insert, the bracket with the screw hole to attach the tire bold was already there. And at one point they listed it as an accessory option on the build it page.

the new RDX at least still has a spare. I would have to check a TLX to see if the tire well is still there."
170,July 12,benjaminh,"@henryn : Good points! I might at some point regret this design. We'll see. AAA response time in my area is usually about 15 minutes, although no doubt that varies. I changed maybe 4 tires between 1980 and 1995, and each time found it a challenging and annoying job. I don't really want to do it again. Because of good luck, good maintenance, and good tires, somehow I don't recall that we've had a flat in the last 7 or 8 years in either my wife's car or my car. My wife's new CR-V has a full-size spare, which is something I haven't seen in a long time. Interesting that our two new cars in their own ways go to extremes on this. @stickguy it's not clear to me if a spare would even fit in the TLX. Maybe those plastic trays can be removed? Not sure. Honestly it doesn't look like it. They seem well built and built-in.

Anyway, you get a pressure sensor on each tire on the TLX. And here's a pic of some of the controls and buttons that are better than on my wife's CR-V."
171,July 12,Michaell,"I noticed the lack of a spare tire on my test drive of the CPO 2015 TLX last weekend. I'm very much on the fence about this issue.

If it's an option, I wonder if / where / how much it would cost to obtain."
172,July 12,stickguy,the plastic insert should pop out. I know for sure in the ILX it did.
173,July 12,benjaminh,"Almost everything about the TLX seems to be significantly higher in quality than an Accord, and often that higher quality comes with some added weight. I assume some designers several years ago said, more or less: here's a way we can save c.40 pounds all at once. And how many people really change their own tires at this point?

Anyway, a few more pix of the new TLX, and a few little observations....The rear windows go completely into rear doors, and that didn't even quite happen with my Accord. Seems to be c. 5 LEDs in the side mirror turn signals compared to I think one with an Accord, trunk hinges are covered and protected, etc. The interior plastic wood or plood actually seems to be something like fake marble, which my son instantly named ""plarble"" lol! I had the owner's manual out because I was trying to figure out how to program the built-in garage door opener. Ultimately my son had to help me, because it involved him hitting a button actually on the garage door opener itself while I simultaneously pressed and held the Hondalink button."
174,July 13,sda,"Keep the comparison review of the Accord/TLX/CR-V coming! Speaking of which, do you find the TLX to be significantly quieter than the Accord and how so? I do believe you can run regular gas without damage in the TLX without too much performance degradation...if Premium gas is recommended and not required."
175,July 13,stickguy,"Premium is recommended in my RDX too, but runs fine on regular. The engine is identical best as I can tell to the Pilot, Accord, etc. I think it even has the same code designation. Same compression ratio, even same power output. The TLX, not sure how much different it is than the Accord motor. Odds are it is fine on regular but might cut performance slightly but only at higher revs.

The new RDX is pretty much a 2.0T Accord motor too."
176,July 13,stickguy,"with tires, it is not just a matter of not wanting to change your own. You can still call AAA. The difference is, if you have a spare, they put it on and you are on your way. No spare, and you are riding in the front seat of a tow truck, or standing on the side of the road waiting for an Uber, while you hope that the tow truck drops your car someplace that can find a tire right away. Just hope you don't get a flat when they are closed!"

Yes, the TLX is quieter than our 2013 and 2016 Accords. This is esp. noticeable over slightly rougher pavement where we got a fair amount of tire/road noise in the Accords. This is muted with the TLX. Starting in 2018 Honda has started using some of the noise reduction engineering adapted from the TLX for the Accord. My guess is that there will probably still be a difference with the TLX even compared to the new generation of Accord, but not as much.

And tonight, I'll confess, I took another pleasure cruise in the TLX—although first I had to go to the gas station to get my first fill-up of premium. And yes, they told me at the Acura dealer that using regular won't hurt your engine, but honestly why would you sacrifice c. 20 horsepower with a car that's designed to use every horse it has. My feeling is that if you aren't going to put premium in a premium car when it's recommended that maybe you should get something else?

Anyway, the lower mpg of 22 was my c. 3 miles of stop and go traffic to the Costco gas station for my premium fill up.

And don't get excited about that upper mpg of 40. I think it's valid (although I need to check with this tank how accurate the mpg meter is), but this was a highway run of about 20 miles with light traffic going an almost steady c. 60-62 mph, although with the AC on fairly high and the car in Sport mode. This was on a series of 55 mph freeways around Louisville. So it's seemingly good mpg, but the reality is I'm usually going more like c.72 mph on 70 mph freeways back and forth between Louisville and Lexington. But if it's accurate, 40 mpg is about as high as I would have gotten in my Accord for this run.



@sda : You might check out a TLX, esp. if you can find one of the last of the 2018s. For a last generation Accord owner imho the TLX Tech a big upgrade, really a wow. I'm still getting lots of smiles from the four wheel steering. And the ELS stereo is really great for listening to SiriusXM and CDs."

180,July 13,benjaminh,"That new 2019 RDX really is a knock out. But you'll pay a lot at this point for one, unless you're getting the base model. One big advantage of the TLX, as I know I've already said in some detail, is that you can potentially lease one for significantly less than a comparable Accord."

No spare in the i3 or 2er; the ti has a spare that has never been used in the 23 years I've owned the car."

183,July 13,henryn,"My worst tire changing experience was on my 2000 F250 diesel, the one I used to pull the 5th wheel travel trailer. I was cruising down Interstate 10 and the right rear tire just let go. This was well out in the country, on the approach to the Brazos River bridge, actually. The break down lane was small, and the dropoff was pretty steep. That F250 was very big, and very heavy, and it came with a tiny bottle jack. I wasn’t really sure it was going to lift the truck, but it did. Precarious is a word that comes to mind for that huge truck perched in the air on that tiny bottle jack.

I got the lug nuts off, but the aluminum wheel had welded itself to the hub. I looked around, found a big chunk of concrete, and used that to try and break the wheel loose. I’m laying under the truck, whacking the back side of the wheel with the concrete chunk, and an 18 wheel tractor trailer comes whizzing by at 80 mph. Sliding by my parked, jacked up truck by about 18 inches, maybe less. So naturally the truck sways back and forth on that tiny bottle jack and I’m thinking, “What a way to die. Crushed under a damned truck trying to fix a flat tire.”

There was another occasion. Not dangerous, but embarrassing. I was pulling the 5th wheel and had a blow out. If you’ve ever owned a travel trailer, then you will already know that they tend to eat tires. I looked around for a good place to get off the road, and spotted some kind of business with a big empty parking lot and pulled in. I’m jacking up the travel trailer (I always carried a really good jack with that thing), and my wife comes around and says, “You realize this is a funeral home, right?”

I look around, and she’s right, it’s a funeral home. I tell her it doesn’t matter, no one is there. Except … They obviously had a service of some kind scheduled, and the parking lot starts filling up. I swear it didn’t take me more than 10 minutes to swap out that tire, but in that 10 minutes the parking lot went from empty to full. And every single person who came in was looking at me like I was transgressing against their dead relative.

Some days …"

I'll just live on the wild side when it comes to spare tires (or lack) and see what happens. No doubt I'll let you know and cry uncle if somehow disaster strikes. But my guess is that the odds of a flat are low on the roads I drive. My second guess is that if I get one the fix-a-flat might work to get me to the gas station. My third guess is that even if a AAA tow truck has to take me to the gas station I'll be ok with it, since I've done that before a few times and it's not a big deal imho. Other things being equal I'd take a spare, but given how much I like almost everything else about the TLX I doubt I'll miss it much. Again, we'll see. I might end up eating my words...."

I've got a buddy over here in Alamogordo that swears by RWD cars. He says they're safer in the ice and snow than FWD cars and, basically, does not shut up about the issue. We just laugh at him and kid him about it - he also criticizes our driving (the other guy's driving, because I pretty much agree with him about this) as far as lane change procedures, putting on our turn signals correctly, etc. He's a stickler for driving accuracy, and, in those matters, I agree with him. I hate it when I'm turning right, for instance, and somebody behind me turns right, but goes around me right into the left lane without turning first into the right lane. I agree with him, that's not how the driver's guide teaches a person when they're first learning how to drive. And how they first teach you goes for lifetime driving.

202,July 10,benjaminh,"The resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedans are weak compared to something like a Honda Accord. As you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. Sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an Accord with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an A4, or a TLX. Even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedans are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car.

I've mentioned before that maybe the most interesting book on the auto industry I ever read is called ""Car: A Drama of the American Workplace"" by Mary Walton, published in 1999. This book was not about a luxury car, but instead about the second generation Taurus, which Ford was trying to push higher in the marketplace. Anyway, one of the memorable things about it for me was that—not surprisingly—every single part on a car goes through a tough process of figuring out what the cost and therefore quality of the part can be. Ford was trying to make the 1996 Taurus a car that people would buy without big rebates, and as it was first designed and for its first year they allowed a higher budget for the cost of various parts so they would feel nicer, and sometimes function better. When the 2nd gen Taurus flopped in the marketplace the project manager had to huddle with his designers and engineers and try to figure out in an almost brutal way how to take something like $1500 in costs out of the car, which involved getting cheaper parts here, there, and everywhere.

Since I read that I've been even more aware than I was before of the quality of big and small things in a car. Sitting in a rental Hyundai Sonata, for instance, I could almost immediately tell that most parts did not get quite as good a budget/engineering detail as the Honda Accords I used to own.

And now with my new TLX, I can tell that the amount spent on most parts is not surprisingly higher than for a Honda. For instance, the steering wheel buttons and controls have a quality and size on the TLX that a Honda just doesn't have. This is partially about aesthetics, but it also impacts function. The adaptive cruise controls etc. are easier and more intuitive to use in the Acura when compared with my wife's new CR-V with its small and comparatively cheap butttons.

Again, given the discounts and incentives that most luxury performance sedans need to move, it's almost like the customer is getting this added quality for very little cost—and in some cases almost for ""free."""

I think you hit the nail on the head. The gadgets and whiz bang bells and whistles keep increasing, but the underlying quality seems to be going the other way; especially in the better ""lower-end"" makes.

Folks would cross shop the Optima to the Accord, IMO.

Any thoughts yet................ Pro's / Cons going from the Accord to a TLX.
Huge difference. Wish I'd done it before. Although it might be that the great deal I got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 TLX. The 2017 TLX iirc lacked AcuraWatch and lacked AndroidAuto, both essential features imho.

On the TLX 2.4 the 0-60 acceleration, to be blunt, seems about the same as an Accord to me—although how you get there is different. At first acceleration seems faster in the TLX in 1st and 2nd, but then as it quickly goes toward 4th, 5th and beyond, it just loses punch. This is all in ""Normal"" mode. I think I might try Sport for a while and see what that's like. The TLX's 2.4 engine, of course, is a slightly souped up version of the Accord's engine that's made to take advantage of premium gas.

But aside from the engine almost everything else is a big upgrade over an Accord. For the most part, you can't even tell that there's any relation between the two cars. The steering with PAWS is sharper and better, the transmission with the 8-speed dual clutch is also a very different experience from a CVT, the leather seats feel as comfortable and supportive as those of the new BMW I was just in yesterday, the suspension has that planted feeling almost like you are riding on rails (but it's still really comfortable), etc. And the the sound system is beyond anything Honda offers, and maybe even better than what's offered in a comparable BMW or Lexus."
231,July 6,brian125,Sounds like a nice upgrade to a Accord. Next time I'm at Acura dealer I will test drive one. Acura's sound system is one of the best systems. Lots of luck with your new ride!

I have never been in an Acura dealership. I've never driven one, and offhand I can't recall ever riding in one. I know a couple of people who own one of their SUVs, but I've never happened to ride with them.

I know the Residual is like 50% and the MF isn't that good, but doesn't Kia have 6700 lease cash? Alfa had the same issue with the Gulita when it first came out, but they lease programs have gotten better.
Kia has changed up the calculus of their lease programs - high MF, low residual but high lease cash.

For 36 months and 12,000 miles per year, MF ranges between .00195 and .00200, residuals between 50-54%, and lease cast between $4800-7200"

The idea of going against 3 rather than 5 is to advertise „it’s bigger, has more power, more stuff and it’s cheaper”. Going against bigger 5 series that has many more available features (even if optional) would make it rather unsubstantiated in eyes of people who are silling to spend north if 60 grand, even uf couple metrics match. Just like the CTS might have been 5er size, it was crossed shopped by 3-series buyers, no matter what Cadillac’s marketng department tried to sell.
On the other hand, it could be judged heavier and less dynamic than the 3'er yet hold its own or be better than the 5'er in those areas. Also, of course, WAY cheaper than a comparable 5."

so doing the math, your saying about 1% make it a decision issue?

While probably accurate, I'd argue the percentage where it does matter is higher. Weight (less of it) assists in better handling, ride, acceleration, fuel economy, and braking. Lighter cars simply feel more toss-able. Those seeking sporty handling will notice it, even if they don't look at spec sheets."

Rick and I stopped and looked a Stinger, it was a GT-1 V6 RWD, MSRP 46K, with all the features and options on this car a BMW 4 series 440i GC would be in the low 60's. It was very roomy in the rear seat, but getting in and out was a PIA. We didn't drive it, but for a 14K difference, I'm not too sure if paying the difference is worth it. The fit and finish was first rate, the salesman needed more training or he got his Audi models confused, he kept saying the Stinger competed against the A8.

Stopped by the Volvo dealer, and was shocked a V90 (wagon) on the lot, according to the salesman, someone ordered it and decided to take a V60 instead. Not too sure why the interior of that V90 was stunning. 55K fully loaded. What a deal, an MB E400 wagon starts at 59K. Volvo has a hit, not too sure why the V90 wagon (not to get confused by the Cross Country) is special order only car."

From what I've read, it doesn't look like Kia will be able to convert the BMW/Audi/MB/Infiniti clientele to give the Stinger a second look, much less a first one.

The N/A straight six had a great sound. Beautiful, I loved it. But in terms of performance and fuel economy, it was a slightly improved product of 1990s. My only concern with my current four turbo is its long term durability. Its first iteration was introduced in 2012 models, so the jury is still out on true long-term numbers. Mid-term seems OK, as there are no massive failures at 100k+ threshold being reported so far. We had a very long track record with the N/A straight six. Those four cylinders are still building the record. One positive, it seems the owners, dealers and garages got the memo regarding proper oil grades this time, unlike in 80s, when turbos were used first time the stakeholders had no idea how to properly maintain those engines. Cheap mineral oil was the king back then, it would sometimes kill the scroller bearings in 60k miles from coking, even if changed at 3k miles, as the oil particles were just too large for fast scrollers."

That's my worry as well, not to mention potential warranty hassles if I took a Stinger to an HPDE. At least you can get it in RWD. Having said all that, my usual strategy of buying a 2-3 year old CPO works great for me, the only downside being the ability to tailor a car to my exact specs- for example if I had ordered my F22 it would have had a red interior, PDC, and no hole in the roof- but the $15,000 savings compensates for the ""imperfections."""

Yes, but in order to really save 14K you'd have to have a car with similar specs and performance, now, you could argue your getting somewhere around 9/10th's for 8/10th's cost. As with everything, there is a law of diminishing returns."

So I went and built a Stinger 2.0 RWD and a BMW 330i, I believe they are as close as you can get, and there is a 7K difference. Now if you pick 4 series then it's close to 9K difference.

348,January 20,stickguy,"yup. Sometimes you get the car without the badge. and sometimes you get the badge, without the car! Up to each buyer to decide what is more important to them. The drive or the prestige (posing)"
349,January 20,dino001,"I have to honestly say, I don't care how something is called, whether it's the ""right brand"", or it ""belongs"" to some category. To me important issues are if the vehicle drives right, has right amounts of features, sufficient reliability record of the model or brand and dealerships that don't treat you like an illiterate. It just so happens that those tastes and financial abilities coincide with number of models that are called ELLPS by many.

However, if Kia, Chevrolet, or Toyota came with a vehicle that has the features, handling and styling, I would consider it, regardless if somebody else calls it ELLPS, or not. It just so happens that up to this point their current lineup is aimed at different buyer demographics, but they could change. For example, Kia came up with Stinger, which looks quite ""tasty"" in the first glance. Even with their legendary obnoxious dealerships (at least here in Tampa Bay) with even more annoying commercials, if I were on the market, I would probably hold my nose and at least take a look and ask for a drive. If it checked all the right boxes, I'd take it. Lower price would be just a bonus. And I don't care if Edmunds' panel of discussion board experts considers that vehicle ELLPS, or not."

When it comes to Hyundai/Kia I think we need to be watching them. The first Gen Stinger is a looker and performs well, but isn't perfect. Give the mid life cycle and next Gen I think the Germans will have problems. For the price of my 330i, I could have bought the top of line Stinger GT and have money leftover and the V6 Stinger is quicker than a 340/440i.

On the other hand, I have fallen in love with the Volvo V90, the design is stunning, and the price is perfect and you don't see many Wagons on the road."
352,January 20,roadburner,"My non-negotiables are RWD, ample(some would say ""too much"") hp, and top-shelf handling and braking- so yes, I'd at least consider a Stinger GT. It could be a bit quicker, but aside from that I would just need to drive it. As dino001 mentioned, for me the primary drawback would be the buying process and probably service as well. At least with BMW I know that I won't have a warranty claim denied because I take my car to HPDEs."
353,January 20,roadburner,"Before I bought my M235i I also considered a Camaro SS 1LE, a Challenger SRT8, a 2013 Boss 302, a 2016 Mustang GT Premium w/Performance Package, a Lotus Elise, a 370Z NISMO, a Cayman S, and a WRX STI, so I didn't confine myself to the ELLPS market segment.
If I was buying a new car today it would almost certainly be an M2 with three pedals; If I wanted another automatic I'd likely go with a fully optioned M240i with sunroof delete.

To each his own; my personal standard is a sub-thirteen second quarter mile- and my 2er just barely qualifies.. Note that I didn't say the GT was slow, only that it could be a bit quicker. The Stinger GT's performance is solidly average for its class- which isn't bad."

I just read the latest road and track last night, and they had a stinger review. They list it at 4.6 0-60, and 13 seconds 1/4 at 109 MPH. Top speed of 167. If that is not enough performance for street use, you need to take up NHRA.
Depending where you look, you might find different numbers. I found 4.2 0-60 and 12.8 quarter miles reported for my '16 TTS. Of course, my car cheats by only having 2 doors and being a coupe, so it's not a sedan, nor entry level."

Dino do tell about your 430 GC!!

When it comes to Hyundai/Kia I think we need to be watching them. The first Gen Stinger is a looker and performs well, but isn't perfect. Give the mid life cycle and next Gen I think the Germans will have problems. For the price of my 330i, I could have bought the top of line Stinger GT and have money leftover and the V6 Stinger is quicker than a 340/440i.

On the other hand, I have fallen in love with the Volvo V90, the design is stunning, and the price is perfect and you don't see many Wagons on the road.
The car is great so far. I picked it up in Munich in June, drove south to Switzerland, then southern France (Provance), swept along Cote d’Azur to Milan and back to Munich. Then picked it up in Spartanburg in late Septempebr and drove home to Tampa. Now it’s almost 9 thosand miles and perfect. Have to admit, although I miss the sound of my previous straight six, the four cylinder turbo is both quicker less thirsty by 20 percent. Even the automatic doesn’t bother me, it’s probably one of the best in the market. The electric steering, which used to be a major issue with early F3x generation, is finally fixed. It’s precise, albeit lighter than my previous 328. No longer Buick like. I think they tweaked standard 4-series, including GC to be slightly more sporty than standard 3. The standard suspension is also quite alright. I got luxury package without adaptive suspension and don’t feel like missing anything.

In other words, the car is just fine with my growing up and getting stiffer in the joints, but maintains most important aspects of the handling. And there is that rear hatch"

Have to remember, as far as I know, the Stinger's class is midsized. Yet magazines always seem fixated on comparing everything to the compact 3-series instead.
3 series in no longer compact. It grew in both size and weight. It is a legitimate midsize today."
363,January 21,qbrozen,"Current 3-series sedan is 182"". 5-series is 194. Kia is 190. So definitely closer to the 5 than the 3."

So the Stinger looks like a legitimate effort from Kia. Let’s hope people will buy it, so it stays in the market. If it is 5-series size, then $50k+ sticker for fully loaded fast supercharged V6 may be ok, considering Kia always throws in decent cash incentives. Low end 2 liter starts 35k, so that’s much more pallatable and separated in price from lux and comparable to four cyl turbos from other brands, too. One knock against is the mpg on GT, when you compare it with, say BMW’s 3.0 six turbo. It souns a bit like the previous gen without much fuel asavinlg tech. It may be a positive for some."

They shouldn't, but they usually do. As I recall, when dealers first started offering DInan tunes on the N55, it bumped them like 30hp and cost 50% more than the aftermarket units that offered double the power increase. I could be misremembering some details, but I believe that was the gist."

I did raise an objection to the tunes for the S4 (and TTS) for that matter costing more than the A3 tune. The S4's is the most expensive.

I asked if ""the cost was based on the MSRP and assumed bank account of said owners?""

The answer was that there were more 2.0T engines to spread the costs around than 3.0T (supercharged) engines. In fact, the 2.0T is used in VW's like the GTI. The 3.0 was limited to S4, Q5, A6, & A7."

Alcon brake systems, rotors, calipers, and slapped the Stasis name on it.

I find Audi, BMW and Kia at top almost shocking. Especially Audi. Interestingly enough, VW is way to the bottom, so it seems even though they share some parts, the overall QC must be much better there. Also, Porsche being closer to VW than to Audi is interesting. I will believe Chrysler's improvement (it jumped over other domestics) if it remains there for a few years. And where is Fiat? Off the scale?

Well, I didn't have much experience with Audi, except my late dad's 2004 A4 TDI (in Poland) that's still with the family, but enough people complained about it even on Edmund's forums, like GG's infamous S4 problems and inept response from the service departments (this was before his even more disastrous CTS when the service guy blamed ""wrong gas"" for for problems with the entertainment system). BTW, I have to say from years of posting, GG looks like a magnet for bad cars.

I'm sure Audi improved, I just found very surprising that they are now at top 3. BTW, I was happy to see BMW also climbing to near top.

Audi's been providing the icing with the cake since the mid 2000's. Where have you been?
Pretty darn consistent at the top right behind Lexus for luxury makes the last 5 years or so. Still, not at Lexus reliability levels yet (or ever).

I think we all saw Cadillac tumbling coming based on @graphicguy experiences. Unlike some that write-off personal experiences reported here as anecdotal, I take it to likely be ""par"" for the course as that is statistically most likely to happen. BMW's improvement is both significant and recent. They weren't that hot in prior years.

Kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. One of the reasons I got one, as they surpassed Honda and Acura for a few years now. Audi's QC is most definitely superior to VW's. Has been for a long time, and most Audi's are still made in Europe while VW's in Mexico.

As to Chrysler's improvement, they had no where to go but up.

Well, they did tend to have AC issues, intake module issues, fuel pump and cam follower issues, and maybe a couple other things (like open sky double moon-roof issues, window regulator issues, and center console latch issue). For a lot of those things they issued super long courtesy 7 year 120 K warranties though as goodwill, and the failure rate was far from 100%. I had a window regulator and AC go bad, and I needed the intake module replaced on my A3 by 106,000 miles (didn't opt for the Open sky so you can't break what you don't have).

Getting a big check to reimburse me for the intake module after the fact went a long way towards making me forget some of those minor issues. Still, considering I drove it like I stole it, was a reliable 06 model.

It was no Lexus, but it wasn't a Neon either. For example, the A3 never needed to be towed."

Nothing really wrong with the Infiniti. I think they softened it too much. The twin turbo 6 was good. Transmission was a bit lazy, but nothing really wrong with it.

2013 s4 now has 40k miles - which I bot used in February 14 with 14k miles so for 26k miles thru New England weather and potholes I have yet to have any issues. Tire swaps for the seasons and regular recommended service. My guess at 45k would prob need to do brakes- which will be expensive. Of current Ellps I don't really see any thing that screams by me for the cash - Audi s5 fastback very cool looking BUT 60k is tough. Kia stinger another that's very interesting - BMW for anything with a 6 is way to expensive for that interior.
Many have commented about getting more in average brand cars and I totally agree- badge envy for me is gone- look at the technology and standard safety features you get with a 18 accord. Speaking of accord - sharp looking in sport form and you can still get a Manual (talking to you Audi)"

Best of all, there’s a lot more driving fun than you’d expect in an entry-level scooter, especially considering its front struts, rear torsion beam setup. Its progressive and predictable in its behavior, so much so, you might wonder when the hot hatch variant will arrive, something you would never say of a Kia Rio in past form.
It lacks the expected Korean floatiness and excessive brake dive, even at extremes. Take a corner too fast, brake hard and crank the wheel and the Rio will scrub off speed while maintaining way more grip than you’d come to expect. Credit the car’s rigid structure; the suspension pieces themselves are nothing special.

When it comes to tech, Kia has you covered with Bluetooth, a six-speaker stereo with satellite radio and a rear-view camera system, seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Standard safety features include six airbags, side-impact door beams, electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, hill-start assist and vehicle stability management.

There's a brand new 2018 Kia Rio5 over at George Gee Kia in Spokane Valley, WA, selling for $14,795. 6-speed stick model."

Probably closer than you think if the 330i has the base suspension. If the 3er has the M Sport or the Adaptive M Suspension all bets are off. Neither car is a rocket sled, but the with a 0-60 in the mid-fives and a fourteen second quarter mile 330i is about 0.5 seconds quicker than the Mazda. The 330i will likely return better fuel economy, especially if equipped wit the superb ZF 8HP automatic.

Getting the upgraded 15 wheels on a fire red Rio may help in the agility tests.

Buick Regal GS vs Mazda6 might be a better square off. The New 2018 Regal is updated and refreshed this year. Lets see if GM builds on some previous model positives . Regal's 2.0- turbo accelerated 0 to 60 mph in 7.2 sec. The Rio just may give it a run for its money down a straightaway"

Also prices have continued to skyrocket in ELLPS. I know what I bought my Audi A4 for in 1998, and I'm not gonna spend my money on their current prices. So ELLPS is more or less out of what I want to pay.

However there are some decently compelling ""mundane"" cars that can be loaded up to levels that approach (and sometimes exceed) ELLPS. If you want the badge then you go ELLPS. If you want much of the actual benefit and to save some cash, then dropping down a market notch is not a bad idea."

we looked at a used Jag XF (2013) Wednesday. Wife was not impressed by the interior (I found the seats fantastic, her less so, but mostly because is was that odd orange color). But the part she found oddest was when I finally figured out how to put the AC on, and the vents rotated open and close. Just seems like a solution to a problem that did not exist, and one more thing to break (expensively).
That's the fun of shopping, looking, smelling, tasting, trying on, driving... Funny, seats, while comfortable, have kinda short bottom cushion for my taste. Gotten used to/adjusted, so no worries. Maybe the one you looked at had the upgraded seats? I have standard black interior, not my first choice, but when you're buying from inventory on New Year's Eve, variety is not your spice of life! I like the overall interior, a bit too much aluminum staring me in the face for my taste, but enough wood to keep me warm.

The rotating vents are a cool feature....the first couple of times you see 'em. You can easily program them to stay open, which I will do as soon as the warranty expires!

Drove into Boston for dinner/show Saturday night. Parking garage, didn't realize until I was all the way in that it was valet only. The attendant told me no worries, they always take special care of Jags! Uh, huh."

220 HP vs. 201 hp for the Hyundai
Torque disparity is larger I believe if I'm not mistaken.
24/33 MPG vs. 26/33 for the Hyundai; now that's close, but the Audi engine is 20% bigger.

Interesting, now I came from a base suspension 320, to a base suspension 330i and the two are worlds difference. The 330 feels more planted, doesn't want to push as much in the corner and I know I can take my fave on and off ramps faster. I feel that the base suspension on the 2016 and newer 3 series is better than before. Now Rick's GT has the Adaptive suspension and I like it, I wish mine had it.. But overall I can't see how a Mazda 6 would come close to a base 3 series on a road course or figure 8"

Pretty darn consistent at the top right behind Lexus for luxury makes the last 5 years or so. Still, not at Lexus reliability levels yet (or ever).

Kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. One of the reasons I got one, as they surpassed Honda and Acura for a few years now. Audi's QC is most definitely superior to VW's. Has been for a long time, and most Audi's are still made in Europe while VW's in Mexico.

Congrats on the 430, so you went with the 8 Spd auto, how you like it? I'm still leaning towards a 440 GC next."
477,October 2017,dino001,"I went with auto, cause there wasn't anything else available with GC. When I was preparing to change from my wagon, I made peace with AT as my next transmissions already some time ago. I decided that the form factor (body type) with equipment and color were more important than the transmission. The transmission is alright - very responsive, efficient, seamless. It isn't manual, but it will do.

I thought I wanted 435, then 440 GC all that time until I spent some good time with the 430/330, got to play with the sport/sport+ modes and became convinced to keep the money, both in the purchase and at the pump. For me it's good enough. I think I'm already past the ""got to have the horses"" stage. There is minimum I want/need, of course, probably higher than the market average, but 430 is quite enough."
478,October 2017,pensfan83,"Aside from a 3 year stint with the Fusion I've had a manual for the better part of the last 15 years, granted not as long as some here but long enough that was very accustomed to the enjoyment of rowing my own gears. I lucked out in 2014 when it came to the A4 however this time my dealer had no manual A4's in stock and no immediate plans to order any, my salesman said they sell on average less than 4-5 per year and most times they sit waiting for a buyers like folks on this board, who are becoming rarer by the day. Like @dino001 I resigned myself to the fact the next car was going to be an auto, which opened up many more options because finding a manual entry level luxury car is like finding hen's teeth. It did also open up another vehicle for my wife to drive, who was confined to her Altima the last 3 years."

Driven the TLX a couple of times (V6). If those incentives were going on when I was looking, my choice might have been different (ended up with a Q50 3.0T, which I like quite a bit).

While only test drives, I never experienced the untoward behavior of the 9-speed transmission in the V6 TLX that others reported. That said, the ones I drove were all in the last 18 mos, and perhaps Acura addressed those issues.

Be interested in the '18 TLX to see if they tweaked more than just the styling."

Agreed. That said, dealers are going to try to hold to MSRP on the '18s for as long as they can. I might look at them this time next year. But, for right now, a $45K '17 TLX SH-AWD ADVANCE would probably be in the realm of $35-$36K. The 4 cyl would probably be close, or maybe even below $30K. Both would be a screaming deal on a fun, reliable car."

You'll be fine. The B8.5 S4 is one of the finest cars ever made. Find a good indy shop for the services. My TTS was quoted $450 (w/ DSG) for the 35K service. I imagine the S4 would be within 10% of that at most.

I think even Honda fans will Admit that there's a reason Acura can't get much more than 90% of MSRP on their sedans the last decade or so though. Combination of overpriced and under-delivering in my opinion.

Acura needs it mojo back. I think Infinity is the new Honda/Acura, and Honda/Acura has become Buick.

The big discounts is really because every car magazine panned and they aren't selling. The V6 does not feel like it has 290hp, in Sport+ the transmission does not shift and crisp and sharp as the 4 cyl. Now I will give the seats major props here very comfortable. The car drove with typical Japanese blandness very isolated feeling. Now, there is nothing wrong with that if that is your thing. The dealer I went really wanted me to take a 6cyl w/Tech but didn't see the real value in it. The only difference between a 4 and 6cyl Tech package is the engine and transmission there is not additional equipment in the 6 cyl since more manufacturers add features Honda/Acura does not."
512,May 2017,sweendogy,Infiniti and Acura are lost for sure... Lexus has at least made the effort with the (ugly?) IS.... They also have the volume es and rx to help the rest of the fleet. Infiniti has 2 highly discounted sedan and suv (pathfinder q) that I guess is the reason Nissan gives them a lifeline. Acura has one real product the MDX. Yes they have a super car which is cool but unfortunately in its current stable you can't look down the line and say it has a real bloodline. The old nsx had the integra r and gsr (had one) to point to.

Infinity, while the Q40/50/60S are all heavy cars, they do have a 400 HP Red-Line and 3.0 L turbocharged power-trains. They seem to be making an effort. I thought the 2.0T was an Infinity engine that Mercedes was using. If it is a Mercedes engine that Infinity is using, it does seem like a strange partnership.

Volvo S60, nice car, but the MF and RV is horrible, so I moved on.
Acura the dealer wanted to move a car, but wasn't all that thrilled on how it drive, either the 4-6 cyl
Lexus IS, drove well, even though the dealer wanted to move a unit, the RV and MF were high as well as lease payments.
MB I don't like the C sedan, even the C43 again they wanted to move a unit but the payments were high.

I went with a 2017 330i that was a service loaner, 2500 miles, Drivers assistance package, Premium Package, Nav, heated seats, Apple Car Play, 18: rims. 41K out the door, 2100 out of pocket, for fees, first month, and a small Cap reduction.

Have to say BMW has firmed up the standard suspension, to almost perfect, I have the same rims and Rick's GT, however, I have 225-45-18's, Ricks are 225-50-18.

I just stumbled on a great ELLPS - Volvo S60/V60 R-Design trim. 305 horses, very nice cabin, all goodies included, around 50 grand sticker. Just drove one, nice steering feedback, better than first intallment on F3x 3-series (improved by now, but still), nice suspension. Drives as well as my 328, it is a bit faster, AWD. Looks good, too. Lots of value. I may be really tempted to save some money versus 440 Grand Coupe, or even 430. Volvo always has some good incentives, or I could also take Overseas Delivery, which doesn't have them, but you get two ticketsvticket on Premium Economy with SAS (4 grand value, I know for a fact), full concierge experience in Goetynburgh and hotel stay. That's more than BMW's ED.

Nobody thinks of Volvo in terms of performance, cause their base trims are targeting different audience and focus on family and fuel economy. They've always had performance trims, but no marketing behind them, therefore nobody knows about those.
I've heard of and looked at them briefly. I believe I looked closely at a S60R that seemed on paper like a pretty close competitor to the S4. Unfortunately, I think it is more like an A4 competitor. It just doesn't win on any specification. And then I believe I saw that they put some rather small skinny 225 or 235 rubber tires on it (not 100% sure which on as it was a while ago). Base S4 starts at 245, with the upgrade wheel using 255. My wife's Sportwagen has 225. That's not a deal breaker as I like after-market wheels anyway, but to me it is a sign of how the engineer's really feel about the performance of their vehicle.

Now, I hope some auto exec doesn't read this and start a tire size war."

Ray's got some auto business out here. I know him for over 30 years met him when he had a small dealership in NJ Cox Cheverlot . We've been good friends ever since. This guy is a sweetheart compared to the ruthless owners out there with his kind of $$$. I joke with him all the time about how much work and money is enough. He's got to be worth close to a BIL. His land Rover brand has a lot of problems with customer complaints and defects. ."

When we were looking for Rick next car, we drive a 2015 RX350, and was very disappointed in it, there was no refinement in that thing. There was no sound deadening, the ride was horrible, and the interior screamed Toyota. The NX we drove was far better but was too small."

What do the max MSDs total out as?
Here is a deal someone posted on Bimmerfest.

How's this deal?
2016 340i - Black sapphire exterior with the coral red interior. M Sport package, tech package, cold weather package, Driver assistance package.
MSRP: $59515
Selling Price: $54230. Thats about 9% off MSRP. Sales rep said it was $1k below invoice
MF 0.00088 with 3.5K in MSDs
1.5k in taxes, $925 acq fee, misc dmv fees, luxury tax, and first payment = another 3.5k

term 10k/36: 0.66 Residual

Monthly: $497

So basically his payment is $497 so you round up to the nearest 50, so that would be $500x7 = 3500. This loweres your MF down.

Hope this helps."

and this..
Mercedes-Benz extended its lead in a race with BMW for the luxury-car sales crown, as a series of new models position it to overtake its rival for the first time in a decade.

A jump in deliveries of SUVs and crossovers helped Mercedes increase sales almost twice as fast as BMW in the first nine months, expanding the Daimler AG unit's lead to 57,985 cars, according to data released by the manufacturers.

Mercedes is poised to achieve its 2020 target of unseating BMW AG's namesake brand as the world's biggest seller of premium vehicles already this year, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said this week, which would put Mercedes back on top for the first time since 2005.

Mercedes is winning over customers with a recently updated lineup of trendy models that appeal to younger buyers, including the GLC coupe and compact GLA sport utility vehicle.

BMW is responding with a revamp of its 5-Series business sedan to rival Mercedes's popular E-Class, adding new self-driving features that control speed, help drivers stay in lane and keep distance to nearby cars.

The 5-Series, set to hit showrooms in February, will range from a four-cylinder hybrid plug-in that can drive 45 kilometers on a single charge, to a more powerful eight-cylinder gasoline version, BMW said in a statement on Thursday.

The car is critical for BMW after an overhaul of its top-of-the-line 7-Series sedan received a muted response.

BMW has downplayed the impending loss of the No. 1 spot, shifting its view to maximizing profit and fund investments in new technologies.

""Profitability remains our primary focus,"" BMW's head of sales Ian Robertson said in a statement on Thursday.

New entrants

Luxury-car makers are racing to compete on self-driving innovations while also having to spend more on developing electric cars to meet increasingly tough emissions regulation.

BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen AG's Audi brand last month outlined a major push into electric cars, which will add to their research-and-development costs. After hiking investment in plants, equipment and new technology from a peak this year, Daimler plans to rein back spending in the years ahead, CEO Zetsche said this week.

BMW's global deliveries rose 9.4 percent to 197,419 cars in September, boosting the nine-month total by 6 percent to 1.48 million vehicles, the company said in a statement.

By comparison, Mercedes's sales jumped 12.1 percent to 211,286 vehicles in September, lifting the total by 11.7 percent to 1.54 million, according to a separate statement. Audi slipped further back in third place with year-to-date deliveries of 1.41 million cars, a 4.5 percent gain.

I like Harmon other wise known as HK. Don't think they should drop the Kardon part. My previous receiver which I still have is an HK. I'm keeping it because they don't make receivers like the two I own anymore. When the Denon konks out I'll switch back to the HK. Heck, I might switch out yearly just for the fun of it.

Biggest advantage the newer Denon has is the ability to read FLAC files. Other then that, the HK is perfect and probably superior despite the fact it's made in China ."

Its a perfect vehicle for folks who want a steady ride and could care less about brand or how uninspiring this vehicle seems when driven like the Audi , Bmw, or MB. Genesis 429 h/p and 9 spd trans works well in this vehicle. I call this new Genesis ( G80 ) the upper class large family sedan bargain .

The Camry XSE V-6 will take some sales away from the Honda Accord. I had a 13 Accord V-6 for 1yr. Very nice vehicle.

What do the max MSDs total out as?
Here is a deal someone posted on Bimmerfest.

How's this deal?
2016 340i - Black sapphire exterior with the coral red interior. M Sport package, tech package, cold weather package, Driver assistance package.
MSRP: $59515
Selling Price: $54230. Thats about 9% off MSRP. Sales rep said it was $1k below invoice
MF 0.00088 with 3.5K in MSDs
1.5k in taxes, $925 acq fee, misc dmv fees, luxury tax, and first payment = another 3.5k

term 10k/36: 0.66 Residual

Monthly: $497

So basically his payment is $497 so you round up to the nearest 50, so that would be $500x7 = 3500. This loweres your MF down.

Hope this helps."

Funny thing; one of our most successful client advisors is an attorney who retired from a large well-respected Louisville law firm. As you might expect, his client base is heavily populated with attorneys. I delivered a 440i convertible to one of his clients who had bought himself the car for a retirement present; he had been a top notch criminal defense attorney and as we walked out to the car he asked, ""Are you as glad to be out of the legal field as much as I am?"""

Mercedes-Benz extended its lead in a race with BMW for the luxury-car sales crown, as a series of new models position it to overtake its rival for the first time in a decade.

A jump in deliveries of SUVs and crossovers helped Mercedes increase sales almost twice as fast as BMW in the first nine months, expanding the Daimler AG unit's lead to 57,985 cars, according to data released by the manufacturers.

Mercedes is poised to achieve its 2020 target of unseating BMW AG's namesake brand as the world's biggest seller of premium vehicles already this year, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said this week, which would put Mercedes back on top for the first time since 2005.

Mercedes is winning over customers with a recently updated lineup of trendy models that appeal to younger buyers, including the GLC coupe and compact GLA sport utility vehicle.

BMW is responding with a revamp of its 5-Series business sedan to rival Mercedes's popular E-Class, adding new self-driving features that control speed, help drivers stay in lane and keep distance to nearby cars.

The 5-Series, set to hit showrooms in February, will range from a four-cylinder hybrid plug-in that can drive 45 kilometers on a single charge, to a more powerful eight-cylinder gasoline version, BMW said in a statement on Thursday.

The car is critical for BMW after an overhaul of its top-of-the-line 7-Series sedan received a muted response.

BMW has downplayed the impending loss of the No. 1 spot, shifting its view to maximizing profit and fund investments in new technologies.

""Profitability remains our primary focus,"" BMW's head of sales Ian Robertson said in a statement on Thursday.

New entrants

Luxury-car makers are racing to compete on self-driving innovations while also having to spend more on developing electric cars to meet increasingly tough emissions regulation.

BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen AG's Audi brand last month outlined a major push into electric cars, which will add to their research-and-development costs. After hiking investment in plants, equipment and new technology from a peak this year, Daimler plans to rein back spending in the years ahead, CEO Zetsche said this week.

BMW's global deliveries rose 9.4 percent to 197,419 cars in September, boosting the nine-month total by 6 percent to 1.48 million vehicles, the company said in a statement.

By comparison, Mercedes's sales jumped 12.1 percent to 211,286 vehicles in September, lifting the total by 11.7 percent to 1.54 million, according to a separate statement. Audi slipped further back in third place with year-to-date deliveries of 1.41 million cars, a 4.5 percent gain.

I like Harmon other wise known as HK. Don't think they should drop the Kardon part. My previous receiver which I still have is an HK. I'm keeping it because they don't make receivers like the two I own anymore. When the Denon konks out I'll switch back to the HK. Heck, I might switch out yearly just for the fun of it.

Biggest advantage the newer Denon has is the ability to read FLAC files. Other then that, the HK is perfect and probably superior despite the fact it's made in China ."

Its a perfect vehicle for folks who want a steady ride and could care less about brand or how uninspiring this vehicle seems when driven like the Audi , Bmw, or MB. Genesis 429 h/p and 9 spd trans works well in this vehicle. I call this new Genesis ( G80 ) the upper class large family sedan bargain .

The Camry XSE V-6 will take some sales away from the Honda Accord. I had a 13 Accord V-6 for 1yr. Very nice vehicle.

The Sandman
MSD's mean Multi Security Deposits, we are taught that when leasing one should never put any money down. However, with MSD, you are basically buying down the money factor (APR) of the lease, which means lowerimg your monthly payment. At the end of your lease you will get your MSD's back or if you want and lease another BMW you can roll the MSD's into your new lease. The added saving for a typical 3 yr lease is about $1900."

The benefit isn't to the leasing company, and those who understand leasing and can negotiate well, can get a better deal with the MSD, then without."

Like in every transaction, both sides get a benefit, or they at least think they do, since it's voluntary. Here, the lesee exchanges cash for lower cost of borrowing (money factor, by extension lower payment). In some way, it's similar to points on mortgage, but temporary, not permanent.

The lessor's benefit is cash today, which they can dispose as they see fit. Being a financial intitution, they are allowed to leverage that money to raise even more funds. Another benefit is more general, i.e. possible increase in product sales. Notice it's offered only by financial arms of some manufacturers."

This page gives a pretty good overview.
I just returned from the mandatory one week instructor led training; there's a strong emphasis on product knowledge as well as how to relate to the clients that we work with. I don't fit the typical genius profile due to the fact that I'm retired from my ""real"" job and thus I'm considerably older; In my class of twenty the next oldest person was about ten years younger than me and the rest were in their early to mid twenties. In addition; I have no interest in a promotion to client advisor or service advisor- although I did ""sell"" a CPO i3 yesterday in that I conducted the presentation and evaluation drive so that the client advisor was able to close the deal in just a few minutes."

Well, not to sound too ""judgmental"", but I truly think somebody who can't come up with 4 grand, has no business shopping a 50 grand vehicle. This is to me something of category of complaining about premium gas on a luxury car. But that's probably just my weird math sense.

Also, it's just plain good savings. Not artificially on payment, like cap cost reduction, but real savings on total amount of money paid out of your pocket. If you do math correctly, that 0.00049 MF on 50K car with 25K residual (not so great one) saves you 0.00049*(50K+25K) times 36 (typical 36 month lease with not-so-hot residual) is 1300, give or take, more if the residual is higher. Who would pay you 1300-1500 bucks on 4 grand over three years???

It's probably one of the best guaranteed rate of return in zero-interest environment (adjusted for risk, of course). It of course is not a real rate of return, just savings in interest charges (or their equivalents in lease).

If you lease, MSD is the way to go, period. There are no excuses. The lower payment is just a side benefit.
Exactly. The problem is, not all manufacturers offer MSD for leases. A quick summary - and I'll let @kyfdx chime in if my information is incorrect.

BMW - 7 MSDs at .00007 each - total MF reduction of .00049
Audi - 10 MSDs at .00005 each - total MF reduction of .00050
Lexus - 9 MSDs at .00008 each - total MF reduction of .00072
MB - no hard evidence on this; have had folks report that MSDs are only allowed on unsupported MF (standard MF is .00200 - .00220), but others have said otherwise

No MSD program for Infiniti or Acura. No information on Jaguar.

No MSD programs for any of the domestic brands."
669,July 2016,kyfdx,Infiniti: 9 MSDs at .00010 each (.00090 total)

683,August 2016,dino001,"I have always maintained Cadillac's dealer network is waaaay too big and does not fit a premium image they want to project. In small and midsize towns, local Chevy or Buick dealer also got a Caddy franchise, so they could sell them to small local business people and their families - model that worked in 70s, when German competition was small and super-exquisite (Benz only sold what today would have been loaded E-class or up, at price point equivalent to today's S-Class) and Japanese brands were literally non-existent.

In today's world with all-out competition in premium at all levels, it simply doesn't cut it - the accessibility is a good thing, but in today's reality it collides too much with exclusivity they wish to project. They'd do better if they pulled sales franchises from those weak dealers, but supplied them with authorized service licenses.

Essentially, you buy your Caddy in a big showroom, comparable to those of MB, BMW, or Lexus, in a nearby big city, but can service it at a local Buick dealer garage, provided it passes the necessary requirements. That model might actually work. In Europe they generally have denser authorized service network than sales. American model somehow is such that if you want to service a brand, you have to sell it, too. No real reason for that, other than ""tradition""."

Sure the mpg's are in the toilet but one doesn't purchase any luxury vehicle like this to get econocar gas mileage. Just like the maintenance, one just knows going in that driving these type of vehicles will cost more but it definitely is worth it for anyone who loves the automobile!

I think there are multiple things going on when it comes to the weak sales of the TLX. Like you, I think it has good styling, but probably for some it still seems to be a bit bland.

The base engine is a very nice 2.4 liter direct-injected model that's a more advanced version of what you get on the Accord. But most competitors have turbo base models that are faster.

The 8-speed in-house dual-clutch transmission on the TLX with the 2.4 has gotten mostly good reviews, but the 9-speed that goes with the V-6 has gotten mixed to negative reviews.

Acura doesn't seem to get much credit for its high quality, durability, and reliability. And the exotic 4-wheel steering that's standard on the car doesn't seem to help it stand out, but no doubt cost a pretty penny to engineer and put into the car.

Finally, the Accord now has AndroidAuto/AppleCarPlay, but the TLX isn't scheduled to get that until the early introduction of the restyled and enhanced TLX that's coming next year as a 2018 model."

Agreed. Plus, the Accord has now started knipping at the heals of the TLX. Acura's cars in their most recent iterations have been hit and miss. ILX, TLX, RLX (especially the RLX) have missed their respective marks, badly.

I still like the TLX (and all of my previous TLs). But, given the transmission woes, and that just about every other lux manufacturer out there offers AWD and some sort of torque vectoring system, which was at one time unique to the TL (and some Audis), isn't so unique any more.

I know holding the prices on the TLX trasnlates into higher resale value, but it's hurting their sales on the new end.

Let's face it, Acura is becoming more an SUV company than a car company."

Not really. Since it's a deposit, you get the money back. Since it lowers the MF, it can be seen as earning interest on the money. So if you take 7xSD, lowering MF on the entire lease amount, you essentially leveraged say 3 grand to reduce interest on say 30-40 grand (average capital cost between purchase and disposition). Translate that money back and you won't get anywhere near interest in a bank, if you keep the money. MSD is nothing like putting money down (cap cost reduction). Not even close. Don't put money down on lease, but MSD - good deal, IMHO."

Well, the '04+ TL was many great things:

1) A Power leader at 270 HP V6 3.2 Standard - In later years that became a 3.5 and 3.7 with good numbers.
2) Was a very good looking sedan with a nice interior.
3) Class-leading super modern audio DVD-audio playing music system (that's special and rare).
4) Handled really well.

The TLX currently in my opinion is:

1) Pretty bland; no visible exhaust either
2) A bottom feeder for power with either engine (as compared to the competition). They don't even offer a 3.7 anymore!
3) If the Audio systems still plays DVD-A discs I'd be surprised pleasantly, I don't know? I know the '14 TL did still play DVD Audio discs.

You get the MSD back at the end of your lease, PLUS save about $50/m on your lease, so that averages out about $1900 on a 3 yr lease. So it's a win/win for you and BMW gets to use the MSD for 3 yrs. You are buying down the money factor of your lease, this where is where you get the saving from."
725,July 2016,brian125,If I remember correctly. Buying 1 MSD point down up to Seven is .000007 going to 000049 on the MF. The only Cons I see is coming up with the extra cash. If your car is totaled or stolen that money is still secure. If you flip your vehicle before lease is up who ever assumes it has to pay you your MSD money. Where can you make 1500 to 2000 dollars profit on that initial upfront investment in 3 yrs?? Its a good deal

That's correct on a BMW, just take one zero out of each number. .00007 and .00049
Also correct on having someone assume your lease. They have to reimburse you for the MSDs."

Yes, this is a great way to lower payments, however, more people don't have an extra 4K sitting around.
Well, not to sound too ""judgmental"", but I truly think somebody who can't come up with 4 grand, has no business shopping a 50 grand vehicle. This is to me something of category of complaining about premium gas on a luxury car. But that's probably just my weird math sense.

Also, it's just plain good savings. Not artificially on payment, like cap cost reduction, but real savings on total amount of money paid out of your pocket. If you do math correctly, that 0.00049 MF on 50K car with 25K residual (not so great one) saves you 0.00049*(50K+25K) times 36 (typical 36 month lease with not-so-hot residual) is 1300, give or take, more if the residual is higher. Who would pay you 1300-1500 bucks on 4 grand over three years???

It's probably one of the best guaranteed rate of return in zero-interest environment (adjusted for risk, of course). It of course is not a real rate of return, just savings in interest charges (or their equivalents in lease).

If you lease, MSD is the way to go, period. There are no excuses. The lower payment is just a side benefit."

733,June 2016,andres3,"DSG might not have the smoothest of shifting characteristics, particularly at low or stopping speed, but when you can bang out consistent 4-1/2 second OR LESS 0-60 sprints in part due to the brilliant ""launch control"" features of the DSG, how can one honestly complain?"
734,June 2016,roadburner,"I'm coming around to the opinion that a manual tends to be more entertaining when the car actually needs a manual gearbox. For example, my 318ti(with a Turner Motorsports Conforti chip) makes around 140 lb-ft of torque at 4500 rpm. You simply must keep the engine wound tight to make anything close to rapid progress- and it's a lot of fun to drive it in that fashion. In contrast, my M235i makes 330 lb-ft of twist from 1300 to 4500 rpm; with such a flat torque curve there is almost always a ton of thrust available regardless of rpm and/or the gear selected. It's also nice to have a car that can convert from cruise mode to track toy mode with the press of a button. If I was buying an M2 or M3 I would definitely go with a manual every time, but in the less intense models an automatic transmission does not detract from my enjoyment of the car- but then at 59 I'm fast approaching geezer status."

They had 650i GC, 550i sedan, 4289GC, X1,X3, X5 40e (plug in) they also has a 340i sedan that was a rolling catalog for the M Sport performance parts. I drove only 4 of them, the 650, 550, X5 and X1. First time driving the 650iGC and I loved it, It handled well, was roomy and it didn't look like a typical sedan, it was fully load, M Sport, Executive package, B&O radio and a couple of other options (don't remember what they were) but the TT V8 is a monster, and I would get tickets in it, the 550 was equipped pretty much the same way and I wasn't that happy with it felt bigger and disconnected but then again the TTV8! The X5 40e was a complete surprise it was comfortable to drive, you have a very commanding view of the road, the power train was great never did I feel being between pure elec and gas engine, the 2L gas engine was peppy enough to move the big X5 without much problem, very refined.. The X1 was a big disappointment but after thinking about it for a couple of day, there was no way the X1 was going to impress me or Rick after driving the other 3 cars, the X1 feels like a much lower price car, lots of road noise and tire noise, the ride was bouncey and never felt planted. plus it was much smaller then I thought it was going to be.

Rick drove the 428GC that was loaded with M Sport and couple of other packages and really liked how it drove, but he did like the 650GC too.

Spoke to a CA and we took out a 640iGC and really liked how that one drove, yeah it's down on power, but the planted feel and comfortable but firm ride was still there.

Yes the N63 (engine code) has had problems and it appears BMW has a fix, the truly sad part really is, Audi and MB both have TT V8 and don't have problems with theirs. I had thought about a 550 in the past but after researching the N63 issues and the factory fix, I'm not totally convinced they have it fixed.

Looks like Audi is on the right track.  Make a great car.  Slowly make improvements based on customer/media feedback as the model progresses.

I hate to be ""that guy,"" but in a couple of years, a CPO S3 or S4 might make a good buy.  I keep seeing more and more Audis on the road.  They definitely ""look the part"" and distinguish themselves from the sea of 3 series and C-Class' out on the road.  

I saw a run of the mill A3 2.0T sedan in grey with what looked like some nice, thick, 5 Spoke silver & black wheels, a lip spoiler that I liked.

783,June 2016,flightnurse,"So the test drive went well, just a little FYI, it was 110 today here in Sunny PHX...

So I test drove two A4's, but 2017, I drove a Premium Plus FWD with a CVT (only transmission that comes with FWD) and a Premium Plus Auto ( Quattro)

I have always liked the looks of the Audi's and their interiors have always been very clean (almost like someone from Denmark designed them) and minimalist at the same time. The size of the A4 is bigger then last Gen, so in comparison it's slight bigger then my 320, but the 3GT has more rear legroom.

I was surprised how well the CVT shifts, but there is still that rubber band feeling, the Auto in the Quattro was better, but not too sure if AWD is really needed here in the Desert. The 252 HP 2L has a lot of motivation, but our 3GT is quicker (it has the BMS stage 1) over all driving the car is drove well, both with CVT or Duel Clutch but I give the Dual Clutch the nod, pricing for the cars are very competitive, you can get a Premium Plus for about 46K fully loaded, very competitive with BMW and a 328i. Even in Quattro you can tell the car is based on FWD. Fit and Finish was first rate, and would give Audi a nod for the feel of the leather over both of our BWW's.

The size of the A4 felt just right not too bed or too small, I'm not too sure if an A6 is needed, plenty of rear leg room and head room, even behind the drivers seat once I adjusted the drivers seat to my liking. I sat in a 2017 S3 and found small and I can see the appeal to it."

I agree, based on that review it looks like Audi TTS-ified the S3. No wonder I liked, but didn't love the '16 and older S3's. That being said the performance enthusiasts will be taking advantage of the new engine's stage 1 tunes coming in at about 350+ HP.

I haven't checked the equipment level on the Honda recently - it certainly may have changed with the recent facelift - but at one point the Acura had a better suite of safety and tech features, such as a true blind spot monitoring system. On the Honda, it seemed you had to get the ""Touring"" model to get that, which got quite expensive. And, for what it's worth, the TLX may be conservative in its own right, but I think it's still more distinctive than an Accord.

Having said that, the Accord is a great car - but I'd take a used TLX over a new Accord. Best value? perhaps a used Accord."

The F pace comes in Diesel and Gas, beginning of June they get their first diesel F Pace, I can't wait to drive it.

Actually, car-wise, there have been good signs for Jag since the '04 XJ's all aluminum architecture (and Ford cash flow). Unfortunately, nobody noticed as it continued the XJ style of the '60s. Handsome, but been there, done that. The current lineup are all winners as vehicles that offer performance, style and quality. From my personal (and, of course a sample set of 1) experience build, reliability and materials are all excellent.

The XE and F-Pace early reviews are almost all big thumbs up. I'm torn, want Jag to survive and thrive, yet selfishly I hate to potentially lose the relative exclusivity of driving a Jag.

My 17 y.o. son believes I'm being selfish, that there's no reason for someone of my advanced years to be driving an XF, when it would so much better serve his purposes. The '02 RX300 he currently is lucky enough to drive would be much better suited to me. Gotta like the attitude, if not the logic!"

If I didn't know a great Indy Audi Shop then I might feel differently about the value of free maintenance. Also, if the car is totaled early in its life, I don't believe you get a penny for ""free maintenance"" back. So it could end up being worthless.

I think BMW found that a few too many non-badge buyers are driving the heck out of these cars, and M brakes are very expensive to service and replace (pads and rotors)."

That's why I'm so disappointed. 3/36 maintenance plans have generally low value, as they cover basic oil change and sometimes air filter. 4/50 plan run into a need of first major service, even on computer based. My brakes are still in good shape, which saved them a bundle (I'm out of 50k already), but many people needed them apparently. There may also be some more fluids to be changed, if your computer senses more severe driving condition.

Wipers are generally cheap, so not much value there, especially that there are some decent aftermarket wipers for $20 or so, but it seems like just pettiness from their part to cut that one. Whatever. I guess dealers can now charge those uninformed good money for their ""genuine"" wiper and even add ""installation fee"" for good 30 minutes of hard work of super-certified technician. BTW, this is not first time I see pettiness in their conduct. My navigation (it's older-generation, still hard disk based system) doesn't have a single automotive store (like AutoZone, etc.), or other brand dealerships in it.

Exactly; they need to get butts in seats before they set prices as high as their competitors."
858,May 2016,dino001,"Cadillac is a tragic case of a complete mismatch between aspirations and reality on many different levels. It all starts with pricing not matching the current perception (whether the perception is correct or not, doesn't really matter at this time), production capacity and sales network. They want to be ""prestigous"", but their production capacity and especially dealer network is a legacy of their heyday well before German and Japanese brands took over that market.

I read that Detroit's problem has always been (across the board for all brands) inability to scale down production to match current demand, which in turn made them incentive addicts. They essentially make a car and then try to sell it. Others often have mindset that they won't make a car until they have some evidence it's actually needed somewhere. It can be a real order (customer's or dealer's - BMW operates that way), deep market studies, or simple case of matching cars that sold (Japanese reportedly do it that way). In other words - they want to (at least virtually) sell the car before making it. Detroit makes it first (because you know, union contracts, sales targets, etc.) and then find a customer for it. Any attempt of changing that mindset, while positive in general long term, requires willingness of taking short or even longer lasting intermediate pain of sales drops, production shutdowns and contract breaks with minor dealers.

For comparison, Tampa Bay (not including Sarasota) has 3 BMW, MB, 2 Audi and 2 Acura, 1 Jaguar store, and only 4 Cadillac stores, which doesn't sound bad. But extend the radius to just 50 miles and the picture changes dramatically: it adds about one dealer for Sarasota for all Germans, one store in Lakeland for BMW and MB, but Cadillac's network grows to 13 stores. Considering sales numbers and it is clearly nuts. May be convenient, but there is no pricing power. I'm sure those dealers are hurting, too. This of course quickly rolls downhill into contentious relationships with customers, as dealer that doesn't have any money will not support their customer.

Cadillac's management keeps wanting to have the cake and eat it. They want large sales, no incentives and high prestige - we all know that ain't gonna happen. You can pick two. They probably know it, too - but their stakeholders are too entrenched and simply unwilling to take the necessary real steps to fix it - they rather pretend doing something and then act surprised that things are not going as planned."

It may be true, but the reality is people don't buy them in numbers produced and those who buy expect pricing below what Cadillac thinks they should pay.

I built a Luxury model online with AWD, Upgraded Wheels (the black ones).  The sticker price shoots close to $50K very quickly (as it does on many entry level luxury performance sedans).  If GM is constantly throwing $10K rebates at these cars at the end of the year, why not lower the cost of entry to begin with?"
864,May 2016,qbrozen,"couldn't agree more. No idea why they just don't lower their prices. I mean, rather than try to get 10k people to pay $2k under and 25k people to pay $10k under, just lower them $5k and kill the rebates and advertise the hell out of the fact that you trump the others in comparison tests AND undercut their prices. You lose $270k with the first scenario but have nothing to crow about vs $175k in scenario 2 with a great selling point."

Simple - there is always a hope for a sucker who will pay more. Moreover, there is also fear that lowering the price won't help - people will still ask for further discount. Not to mention 5k is probably more than their profit margin on first production year, perhaps even longer. Last - they still think ""It's a Cadillac"" means, the sticker has to be high, cause you know, it meant that 30 years ago."

Lots of truth in your last paragraph!
CG what has happened with your CTS? Had Caddy made good on fixing it?

Now I like the CTS, but I really think Caddy needs to stop with these half size cars. The ATS is a 3 series fighter, but it's smaller on the inside. The CTS is a 5 series fighter however, it's is smaller inside, and slight larger then a 3 series. I would assume if they want to compete with the 3 and 5 series they need to be competitive on all fronts. For my next car I'm leaning towards the new 5 series, but will look at the A6 and E class, but the CTS isn't on my list until it competitive in the interior space like the other cars."
867,May 2016,graphicguy,"FN...Cadillac took the '14 CTS back. I was still PO'd but they gave me a new '16 and some pocket money for my troubles. '16 is what the '14 should have been. CTS came out of the blocks about 18 months before it was fully baked, at least in my case.

'16 has been perfect. These new Caddys are really nice cars. They're built well. They use very nice materials in them, they look great, and they perform and handle great. But, that's not what people want from Caddy. They want the Caddy that's in the Escalade.

Not sure I'll buy another, but so far, I'm loving the '16 version.

But, as others point out, it's not enough to build a really good car. Perception is what makes people pony up. Funny, people are willing to buy the most expensive Cadillac, but it's the poorest performer. Again, perception.....

The best Cadillacs are the ATS and the CTS, but people are avoiding them. I know resale is terrible, but I bought my CTS for what a cheaper 3 series or C300 would cost. But, it's as good, and in many respects better, than the E Class or 5 Series.

I saw an M235i convertible at the car show this past winter. If I had my check book with me, I would have bought it on the spot. Luckily, my rational angel replaced my demon by the time I left the car show."

869,May 2016,graphicguy,"@laurasdada....if I decide to go A6/5/E/CTS/GS range again this next go round. I've put the XF at the very top of that list. If Cadillac hadn't come through in replacing my lemon, that's what would be sitting in the GG estate right now.

Beautiful car that drives surprisingly well.

As you say, not as spacious as a 5, E or A6, but about the interior space of the CTS, which is really more than I need anyway."

Cadillac seems to be driving itself into a ditch. Cadillac was #1 in luxury sales from about 1920 until the late 1990s—only 20 years ago.

As most of you are tired of hearing me saying , Cadillac remain relatively stagnant until everyone who bought one in the 1980s is dead. We have about another ten years, if Cadillac can chug along until then.

Another problem, aside from the dubious reputation of the past tarnishing their quite good products of the present, is, as you have all mentioned, unrealistic pricing. This seems to keep their sales figures firmly rooted to the same numbers, year after year.

And say, where's Jaguar? I'm actually quite worried about that company. Let's hope jumping into the SUV market will save them---if that flops, I think you can kiss them goodbye. They are only at 25% of their 2002 U,S, sales figures.

Cadillac, on the other hand, has been pretty consistent, hovering in the 200,000 range per year since 2002. They seem to be on a 175,000 pace for 2016. So, same-o, same-o for Cadillac.

Volvo is at about 70% of its 2002 numbers, and seem to be on an upswing of sorts."
871,May 2016,stickguy,"If I get a jag, will definitely be a lease, so they only need to survive 4 years more from now!

Volvo, I think they stay. New owners will want to keep the US market in place. New product us helping."

Where in the interior do you find it lacking? Just doing a quick comparo online, the CTS has 4.4"" more front legroom than the E and 4.3"" more than the 5. It falls right in the middle with rear legroom at only 0.4"" less than the E but 0.1"" more than the 5."
873,May 2016,laurasdada,"The Jag F-Pace, like the XE, is getting very good early press. Automobile Mag (online, at least) has a ""first and second"" drive impression articles, they're still looking for faults.

While the XE is a handsome, muscular looking beast, I really wish they had gone away from the Germans sedan styling theme of same sausage, different lengths. But, along with the F-Pace, as their likely bread and butter models, can't start too out there, I guess.

My XF, still flawless at 29+ months and ~26k miles. Well, the windshield wipers are due to be replaced, so not perfect!"

A 10 year warranty with a guaranteed loaner/rental when needed would help speed that along."
