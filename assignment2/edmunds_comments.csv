The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side.

Yes, the completely noncomparable M2 would beat the Stinger on track, as would a corvette or sportbike, BTW.",

Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers? If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers.","I am the poster formerly known as benjaminh and now as benjaminhf. Just wanted to say I'm still alive, but my 17 year history with Edmunds has seemingly been erased. Also I've been very busy with work.

Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store. It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer. It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those. Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership. The difference is subtle, but perceptable. It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment). To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone.",

Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store. It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer. It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those. Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership. The difference is subtle, but perceptable. It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment).

Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers? If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers.

Yes, the completely noncomparable M2 would beat the Stinger on track, as would a corvette or sportbike, BTW.",

Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers? If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers.","I am the poster formerly known as benjaminh and now as benjaminhf.

Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store. It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer. It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those. Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership. The difference is subtle, but perceptable. It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment). To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone.",

Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers? If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople.

The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side.
I still think my next car will be either an M2 or an M2C.
Why not a Genesis G70 with a manual?","Again, the local dealer are hopeless at best(What can I do to put ya in a car today, pal?)- and with the well know Hyundai proclivity to void warranties at the drop of a hat I could see problems with using it as my instructor car."

Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers? If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers.","I am the poster formerly known as benjaminh and now as benjaminhf.

Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store. It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer. It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those. Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership. The difference is subtle, but perceptable. It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment). To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone.",

7-Sep,dino001,"If they keep it around in next four-five years, I think I will make myself to put on a hazmat suit and visit our friendly Kia dealer (oh, boy are they horrible here, or what) to check it out. It's got a lot of good stuff, but seems like they are still behind on a few things, such as relationship between power and gas mileage (e.g. BMW 340/440 has similar performance, but much better gas mileage as a daily driver), but with appropriate price difference, those objections and shortcomings are not insurmountable. Biggest thing will be the ""first contact"" with a sales person. Hope it won't start from ""are you buying it today?"", ""what can I do to make you take it home?"", or ""let me wash your BMW - oh, I can't find the keys"", ""How about I show you the deal - square one, two, three, four"".","The lease rate is the factor that stops me cold from taking the leap.

Yes, the completely noncomparable M2 would beat the Stinger on track, as would a corvette or sportbike, BTW.",
